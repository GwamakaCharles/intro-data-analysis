# Introduction to Data Analysis 

The book introduces key concepts of data analysis from a frequentist and a Bayesian tradition. It uses R to handle, plot and analyze data. It relies on simulation to illustrate selected statistical concepts.

Overiew:

1. **general introduction**

- what stats is about
- different practices
- learning goals

2. **data**

*learning goal:* how to arrange, summarize and visualize (aspects of data) to address a question of interest ("hypothesis-driven data poking")

- different kinds of data
- summary statistics
- data wrangling
- data plotting

3. **probability**

*learning goal:* get comfortable with basic notions of probability theory

- probability distributions
- random variables
- conditional probability
- selected distributions

4. **models**

*learning goal:* diagnosing the (conceptual) differences between kinds of statistical models

- priors & likelihood
- conceptual differences between frequentist and Bayesian approaches (revisited)
- notation (probabilistic causal networks)
- three example models:
  - "binomial model"
  - "factorial-design model"
  - simple linear regression model

5. **inference**

- MLE vs posterior
- confidence intervals
- credible intervals
- briefly: algorithms for MLE & Bayesian inference

6. **hypothesis testing**

- binomial test 
- t-test
- ANOVA
- linear regression

7. **model comparison**

- AIC
- likelihood ratio test
- Bayes factor

8. **generalized regression modeling**

- applications
