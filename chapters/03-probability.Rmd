# Basics of Probability Theory


**to be covered:** axiomatic definition, interpretation, joint distributions,
marginalization, conditional probability & Bayes rule. Random variables: discrete and
continuous, expected values & variance, examples.

**learning goal:** get comfortable with basic notions of probability theory

## Probability

### Outcomes, events, observations

We are interested in the space $\Omega$ of all *elementary outcome* $\omega_1,
\omega_2, \dots$ of a process or event whose execution is (partially) random or
unknown. Elementary outcomes are mutually exclusive. The set $\Omega$ exhausts all
possibilities.^[For simplicity of exposure, we gloss over subtleties arising when
dealing with infinite sets $\Omega$. We make up for this when we define probability
*density* functions for continuous random variables, which is all the uncountable
infinity that we will usually be concerned with in applied statistics.]
  

**Example.** The set of elementary outcomes of a single coin flip is $\Omega_{\text{coin flip}} =
  \set{\text{heads}, \text{tails}}$. The elementary outcomes of tossing a six-sided die is
  $\Omega_{\text{standard die}} = \{$ &#9856; , &#9857; , &#9858; , &#9859; ,
    &#9860; , &#9861; $\}$.^[Think of $\Omega$ as a partition of the space of all possible ways in
  which the world could be, where we lump together into one partition cell all ways in which
  the world could be that are equivalent regarding those aspects of reality that we are
  interested in. We do not care whether the coin lands in the mud or in the sand. It only
  matters whether it came up heads or tails. Each elementary event can be realized in myriad
  ways. $\Omega$ is our, the modellers', first crude simplification of nature, abstracting away aspects we
  currently do not care about.]
