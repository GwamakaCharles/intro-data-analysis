# Data, variables & experimental designs {#Chap-02-01-data}

The focus of this course is on data from behavioral psychology experiments.^[A *behavioral experiment* is an experiment that records participants' behavioral choices, such as button clicks or linguistic responses in the form of text or speech. This contrasts with, say, *neurological experiments* in which participants' brain activity is recorded, such as fMRI or EEG, or, e.g., in a psycholinguistic context, *processing-related experiments* in which secondary measures of cognitive activity are measured, such as eye-movements, pupil dilation or galvanic skin responses.] In a sense, this is perhaps the most "well-behaved" data to analyze and therefore an excellent starting point into data analysis. However, we should not lose sight of the rich and diverse guises of data that are relevant for scientific purposes. The current chapter therefore starts with sketching some of that richness and diversity, and only then hones in on some basic distinctions of the kinds of data we will frequently deal with in the cognitive sciences.

The learning goals for this chapter are:

- appreciate the diversity of data
- distinguish different kinds of variables
  - dependent vs independent
  - nominal vs ordinal vs metric
- get familiar with basic aspects of experimental design
  - factorial designs
  - within- vs between subjects design
  - repeated measures
  - randomization, fillers and controls
  - sample size
- understand the notion of "tidy data"
```

## Different kinds of data

- definition of "data"
- sources of data
  - empiriccal data vs virtual data
  - observation vs experiment
    - causation vs correlation
- what to do with data
  - explanation vs prediction

## On the notion of "variables"

- rectangular data

- open/closed categories
- types of variables 
  - dependent vs independent
  - nominal vs ordinal vs metric

## Basics of experimental design

  - factorial designs
  - within- vs between subjects design
  - repeated measures
