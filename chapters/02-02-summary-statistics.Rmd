# Summary statistics

- simple summary statistics (theory)
  - mean/mode/median/quantiles/bootstraped CI of mean
  - variance, standard deviation
  - ...
- exploring dependencies in data
  - plotting schemes
  - correlation
    - Bravais-Pearson
    - Spearman/Kendall
    - ...
  - multiple correlations
    - show `pairs` plots
    - find a good data set (also for later in simple linear regressions)


## Exploring numerical data in a vector {#02-02-exploring}

The first part of the Mental Chronometry experiment is a simple reaction time task.

```{r}
# read a data set of reaction times (as a tibble)
# RTs <- read_csv("https://tinyurl.com/y4jo8mox")
RTs <- read_csv("data_sets/ch-03-set-01-MC-RTs.csv")

# check its content
glimpse(RTs)
