Based on a model $M$ with parameters $\theta$, parameter estimation addresses the question of which values of $\theta$ are good estimates, given some data $D$. Bayesian and frequentist approaches differ in what they consider a good, or the best estimate. Bayesian approaches take the prior into account, frequentist approaches do not (unsurprisingly). 

Parameter estimation is traditionally governed by two measures: (i) a point-estimate for the best parameter value, and (ii) an interval-estimate for a range of values that are considered "good enough". Table \@ref(tab:ch-03-03-estimation-overview) gives the most salient answers that each approach gives.

## Bayes rule of parameter estimation  {#ch-03-03-estimation-bayes}

Fix a Bayesian model $M$ with likelihood $P(D \mid \theta)$ for observed data $D$ and prior over parameters $P_M(\theta)$. We then update our prior beliefs $P(\theta)$ to obtained posterior beliefs by Bayes rule:^[Since parameter estimation is only about one model, it should do not harm to omit the index $M$ in the probability notation. Moreover, since in many contexts the meaning will be  clear enough, we follow common practice and write $P(D \mid \theta)$ as a shortcut for $P(\mathcal{D} = D \mid \Theta = \theta)$. Here $\mathcal{D}$ is the class of all relevant observable data and $\Theta$ is the range of a possibly high-dimensional vector of parameter values. We diverge from common practice of using capital roman letters for random variables and small roman letters for values from these random variables, because parameter vectors are traditionally written as $\theta$ and the small letter $\textrm{d}$ (albeit non-italic) is reserved fro differentials.]

$$P(\theta \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid \theta) \ P(\theta)}{P(D)}$$

The ingredients of this equation are:

- the **posterior distribution** $P(\theta \mid D)$ specifying our beliefs about how
  likely each value of $\theta$ is given fixed $k$;
- the **likelihood function** $P(D \mid \theta)$ specifying how likely each observation
  of $k$ is for a fixed $\theta$ (here given by the binomial distribution);
- the **prior distribution** $P(\theta)$ specifying our initial (aka.~*a priori*)
  beliefs about how likely each value of $\theta$ might be;
- the **marginal likelihood** $P(D) = \int P(D \mid \theta) \ P(\theta) \ \text{d}\theta$
  specifying how likely an observation of $k$ is under our prior beliefs about $\theta$.

A frequently used shorthand notation for probabilities is this:

$$\underbrace{P(\theta \, | \, D)}_{posterior} \propto \underbrace{P(\theta)}_{prior} \ \underbrace{P(D \, | \, \theta)}_{likelihood}$$

where the "proportional to" sign $\propto$ indicates that the probabilities on the LHS are defined in terms of the quantity on the RHS after normalization. So, if $F \colon x \mapsto \mathbb{R}^+$ is a positive function of non-normalized probabilities, $P(x) \propto F(x)$ is equivalent to $P(x) = \frac{F(x)}{\sum_{x'} F(x')}$.

This notation makes particularly clear that the posterior distribution is a "mix" of prior and likelihood. Let's explore this first, before worrying how to compute posteriors concretely.

### The effects of prior and likelihood on the posterior

We consider the case of flipping a coin with unknown bias $\theta$ a total of $N$ times and observig $k$ heads (= successes). This is modeled with the  **Binomial Model** (see Section \@ref(Chap-03-03-models-examples)), using priors expressed with a [Beta distribution](app-91-distributions-beta), giving us a model specification as: 

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
k & \sim \text{Binomial}(N, \theta) \\ 
\theta & \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)
\end{aligned}
$$

<div style = "float:right; width:8%;">
<img src="visuals/skull_king.png" alt="badge-data-wrangling">  
</div>  

To study the impact of the likelihood function, we compare two data sets. The first one is the contrived "24/7" example where $N = 24$ and $k = 7$. The second example uses a much larger naturalistic data set stemming from the [King of France](app-93-data-sets-king-of-france) example, namely $k = 109$ for $N=311$. These numbers are the count of "true" responses for all conditions except for Condition 1, which did not involve a presupposition. 


```{r, echo = F}
data_KoF_cleaned <- read_csv('data_sets/king-of-france_data_cleaned.csv')
```

```{r, eval = F}
data_KoF_cleaned <- read_csv(url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michael-franke/intro-data-analysis/master/data_sets/king-of-france_data_raw.csv'))
```

```{r}
data_KoF_cleaned %>% 
  filter(condition != "Condition 1") %>% 
  group_by(response) %>% 
  dplyr::count()
```


We can plot the likelihood function for both data sets like so:

```{r, echo = F, fig.cap = "Likelihood for the two examples of bimoial data."}
lh_tibble <- 
  tibble(
  theta = seq(0,1, length.out = 401),
  `24/5` = dbinom(7, 24, theta),
  `King of France` = dbinom(109, 311, theta)
) 

lh_tibble %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -1,
    names_to = "example",
    values_to = "likelihood"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, y = likelihood, color = example)) +
  geom_line(size = 3) +
  facet_wrap(.~example, nrow = 2, scales = "free") +
  guides(color = F) +
    labs(
    x = latex2exp::TeX("Coin bias $\\theta$"),
    y = latex2exp::TeX("Prior probability $P_{M_i}(\\theta)$"),
    title = latex2exp::TeX("Binomial likelihood function for different data sets.")
  )
```


Picking up the example from Section \@ref(Chap-03-02-models-priors), we willl consider the four types of priors show below:

```{r ch-03-03-estimation-types-of-priors, echo = F, fig.cap = "Examples of different kinds of Bayesian priors for the Binomial Model."}
prior_tibble <- tibble(
  theta = seq(0, 1, length.out = 401),
  objective = dbeta(theta, 0.5, 0.5),
  uninformative = dbeta(theta, 1, 1),
  `weakly informative` = dbeta(theta, 5, 2),
  `strongly informative` = dbeta(theta, 50, 20)
) 

prior_tibble %>% 
    pivot_longer(
    cols = -1,
    names_to = "prior_type",
    values_to = "prior"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, y = prior)) +
  geom_line(size = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~ prior_type, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    x = latex2exp::TeX("Coin bias $\\theta$"),
    y = latex2exp::TeX("Prior probability $P_{M_i}(\\theta)$"),
    title = latex2exp::TeX("Different kinds of priors over bias $\\theta$ (Binomial Model family).")
  ) 

```

Combining the four different priors and the two different data sets, we see that the posterior is indeed a mix of prior and likelihood. In particular we see that the strong informative prior has only little effect if there are many data points (the KoF data).

```{r ch-03-03-estimation-posteriors-comparison, echo = F, fig.cap = "Posterior beliefs over coin biases under different priors and different data sets."}
full_join(lh_tibble, prior_tibble, by = 'theta') %>% 
    pivot_longer(
    cols = 2:3,
    names_to = "example",
    values_to = "likelihood"
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = 2:5,
    names_to = "prior_type",
    values_to = "prior"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    posterior = likelihood * prior
  ) %>%  
  filter( posterior != Inf) %>% 
  group_by( example, prior_type) %>% 
  mutate(
    posterior = posterior/sum(posterior)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, y = posterior, color = example)) +
  geom_line(size = 2) +
  guides(color = F) +
  facet_grid(example ~ prior_type, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    x = latex2exp::TeX("Coin bias $\\theta$"),
    y = latex2exp::TeX("Posterior probability $P_{M_i}(\\theta \\, | \\, D)$"),
    title = latex2exp::TeX("Posterior beliefs in $\\theta$ for different priors and data.")
  ) 
```

### Posterior means and credible intervals

Let's consider the "24/7" example with a flat prior again, concisely repeated in Figure \@ref(fig:ch-03-03-estimation-24-7-overview).

```{r ch-03-03-estimation-24-7-overview, echo = F, fig.cap = "Prior (uninformative), likelihood and posterior for the 24/7 example.", fig.height = 12}

prior_plot_24_7 <-

    prior = dbeta(seq(0.01,1, by = 0.01), 1, 1 )
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, y = prior)) + 
  xlim(0,1) + 
  geom_line(color = project_colors[1], size = 2) +

    title = "Prior"
  )

hdiData <- tibble(
  theta = rep(hdi, each = 2),

)
expData <- tibble(

)

The posterior probability distribution in Figure \@ref(fig:ch-03-03-estimation-24-7-overview) contains rich information. It specifies how likely each value of $\theta$ is, obtained by updating the original prior beliefs with the observed data. Such rich information is difficult to process and communicate in language. It is therefore convenient to have conventional means of summarizing the rich information carried in a probability distribution like in Figure \@ref(fig:ch-03-03-estimation-24-7-overview). Customarily, we summarize in terms of a point-estimate and/or an interval estimate. The *point estimate* gives information about a "best value", i.e., a salient point, such as the expectation (in Bayesian approaches) or the most likely value (in frequentist approaches (see below)). The *interval estimate* gives, usually, an indication of how closely other *good values* are scattered around the *best value*.

A common Bayesian point estimate of coin bias parameter $\theta$ is **the mean of the posterior distribution**. It gives the value of $\theta$ which we would expect to see, when basing out expectations on the posterior distribution:
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \mathbb{E}_{P(\theta \mid D)} = \int \theta \ P(\theta \mid D) \ \text{d}\theta
\end{aligned}
$$
If we start with flat beliefs, the expected value of $\theta$ after $k$ successes in $N$ flips
can be calculated rather easily as $\frac{k+1}{n+2}$.^[This is also known as *Laplace's
  rule*, or the *rule of succession*.] For our example case, we calculate the expected value of
$\theta$ as $\frac{8}{26} \approx 0.308$ (see also Figure \@ref(fig:ch-03-03-estimation-24-7-overview)).

```{block2, type="infobox"}
**Remark: Maximum _a posteriori_** Another salient point-estimate to summarize a Bayesian posterior distribution is the MAP (maximum _a posteriori_). The map is the parameter value (tuple) that maximizes the posterior distribution:
  
$$ \text{MAP}(P(\theta \mid D)) =  \arg \max_\theta P(\theta \mid D) $$
  
While the mean of the posterior is "holisitic" in the sense that it depends on the whole distribution, the MAP does not. The mean is therefore more faithful to the Bayesian ideal of taking the full posterior distribution into account. Moreover, depending on how Bayesian posteriors are computed / approximated, the estimation of a mean can be more reliable than that of a MAP.
```

A common Bayesian interval estimate of coin bias parameter $\theta$ is a **credible interval**.^[Also frequently called "highest-density intervals", even when we are dealing not with density but probability mass.] An interval $[l;u]$ is a $\gamma\%$ credible interval for a random variable $X$ if two conditions hold, namely
$$
\begin{aligned}
  P(l \le X \le u) = \frac{\gamma}{100}
\end{aligned}
$$
and, secondly, for every $x \in[l;u]$ and $x' \not \in[l;u]$ we have $P(X=x) > P(X = x')$. Intuitively, a $95\%$ credible interval gives the range of values in which we believe with
relatively high certainty that the true value resides. Figure \@ref(fig:ch-03-03-estimation-24-7-overview) indicates the $95\%$ credible interval, based on the posterior distribution $P(\theta \mid D)$ of $\theta$, for the 24/7 example.^[Not all random variables have a credible interval for a given $\gamma$, according to this definition. A bimodal distribution might not, for example. A bi-modal distribution has two regions of high probability. We can therefore generalize the concept to a finite set of disjoint convex *credible regions*, all of which have the second property of the definition above and all of which conjointly are realized with $\gamma\%$ probability. Unfortunately, common parlor uses the term "credible interval" to refer to credible regions as well. The same disaster occurs with alternative terms, such as "$\gamma\%$ highest-density intervals", which also often refers to what should better be called "highest-density regions".]

### Computing Bayesian posteriors with conjugate priors

Bayesian posterior distributions can be hard to compute. Usually, the prior $P(\theta)$ is easy to compute (otherwise we might choose a different one for practicality). Usually, the likelihood function $P(D \mid \theta)$ is also fast to compute. Everything seems innocuous when we just write:

$$\underbrace{P(\theta \, | \, D)}_{posterior} \propto \underbrace{P(\theta)}_{prior} \ \underbrace{P(D \, | \, \theta)}_{likelihood}$$

But the real pain is the normalizing constant, i.e., the marginalize likelihood a.k.a. the "integral of doom", which to compute can be intractable, especially if the parameter space is large and not well-behaved:

$$P(D) = \int P(D \mid \theta) \ P(\theta) \ \text{d}\theta$$

Section \@ref(Ch-03-03-estimation-algorithms) will therefore enlarge on methods to compute or approximate the posterior distribution efficiently.

Foortunately, computing Bayesian posterior distributions need not always be intractable. If the prior and the likelihood function cooperate, so to speak, the computation of the posterior can be as simple as sleep. The nature of the data often prescribes which likelihood function is plausible. But we have more wiggle room in the choice of the priors. If prior $P(\theta)$ and posterior $P(\theta \, | \, D)$ are of the same family, i.e., if they are the same kind of distribution albeit possibly with different parameterizations, we say that they **conjugate**. In that case, the prior $P(\theta)$ is called **conjugate prior** for the likelihood function $P(D \, | \, \theta)$. from which the posterior $P(\theta \, | \, D)$ is derived.

```{theorem, "Conjugacy-beta-binomial"}
The Beta distribution is the conjugate prior of binomial likelihood. For $\theta \sim \text{Beta}(a,b)$ as prior and data $k$ and $N$, the posterior is $\theta \sim \text{Beta}(a+k, b+ N-k)$.
```


```{proof}
By construction, the posterior is:
$$P(\theta \mid \langle{k, n \rangle}) \propto \text{Binomial}(k ; n, \theta) \ \text{Beta}(\theta \, | \, a, b) $$


We extend the RHS by definitions:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
\text{Binomial}(k ; n, \theta) \ \text{Beta}(\theta \, | \, a, b) & = \theta^{k} \, (1-\theta)^{n-k} \, \theta^{a-1} \, (1-\theta)^{b-1}  \\  & = \theta^{k + a - 1} \, (1-\theta)^{n-k +b -1}
\end{aligned}
$$

This latter expression is the non-normalized Beta-distribution for parameters $a + k$ and $b + N - k$, so that we conclude with what was to be shown:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
P(\theta \mid \tuple{k, n}) & = \text{Beta}(\theta \, | \, a + k, b+ N-k)
\end{aligned}
$$
```

&nbsp;

### Sequential updating

Ancient wisdom has coined the widely popular proverb: "Today's posterior is tomorrow's prior." Suppose we collected data from an experiment, like $k = 7$ in $N = 24$. Using uninformative priors at the outset, our posterior belief after the experiment is $\theta \sim \text{Beta}(8,18)$. But now consider what happened at half-time. After half the experiment, we had $k = 2$ and $N = 12$, so our beliefs followed $\theta \sim \text{Beta}(3, 10)$ at this moment in time. But using these beliefs as priors, and observing the rest of the data would consequently result in updating the prior $\theta \sim \text{Beta}(3, 10)$ with another set of observations $k = 5$ and $N = 12$, giving us the same posterior belief as what we would have gotten if we updated in one swoop. Figure \@ref(fig:ch-03-03-estimation-sequential-updates) shows steps through belief space, starting uninformed, and observing one piece of data at a time (going right for each outcome of heads, down for each outcome of tails).

```{r ch-03-03-estimation-sequential-updates, echo = F, fig.cap = "Beta distributions for different parameters. Starting from an uninformative prior (top left), we arrive at the posterior distribution in the bottom left, in any sequence of sequentially updating with the data.", fig.height = 8}
expand_grid(
    theta = seq(0,1,length.out = 41),
    a = 1:7,
    b = 1:4
  ) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(
    probability = dbeta(theta, a, b),
    parameters = str_c("a=", a, " b=", b)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = theta, y = probability)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~parameters, scales = "free", nrow = 7) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x=element_blank(),
    axis.text.x=element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
    axis.title.y=element_blank(),
    axis.text.y=element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y=element_blank()
  )
```


This sequential updating is not a peculiarity of the Beta-Binomial case or of conjugacy. It holds in general for Bayesian inference. Sequential updating is a very intuitive property, but it is not shared by all other forms of inference from data. That Bayesian inference is sequential and commutative follows from commutativity of multiplication of likelihoods (and the definition of Bayes rule).

```{theorem, "Sequential-update"}
Bayesian posterior inference is sequential and commutative in the sense that for a data set $D$ which is comprised of two mutually exclusive subsets $D_1$ and D_2$ such that $D_1 \cup D_2 = D$,we have:

$$ P(\theta \mid D ) \propto P(\theta \mid D_1) \ P(D_2 \mid \theta) $$  

```

```{proof}
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(\theta \mid D) & = \frac{P(\theta) \ P(D \mid \theta)}{ \int P(\theta') \ P(D \mid \theta') \text{d}\theta'} \\
& = \frac{P(\theta) \ P(D_1 \mid \theta) \ P(D_2 \mid \theta)}{ \int P(\theta') \ P(D_1 \mid \theta') \ P(D_2 \mid \theta') \text{d}\theta'} & \text{[from multiplicativity of likelihood]} \\
& = \frac{P(\theta) \ P(D_1 \mid \theta) \ P(D_2 \mid \theta)}{ \frac{k}{k} \int P(\theta') \ P(D_1 \mid \theta') \ P(D_2 \mid \theta') \text{d}\theta'} & \text{[for random positive k]} \\
& = \frac{\frac{P(\theta) \ P(D_1 \mid \theta)}{k} \ P(D_2 \mid \theta)}{\int \frac{P(\theta') \ P(D_1 \mid \theta')}{k} \ P(D_2 \mid \theta') \text{d}\theta'} & \text{[rules of integration; basic calculus]} \\
& = \frac{P(\theta \mid D_1) \ P(D_2 \mid \theta)}{\int P(\theta' \mid D_1) \ P(D_2 \mid \theta') \text{d}\theta'} & \text{[Bayes rule with } k = \int P(\theta) P(D_1 \mid \theta) \text{d}\theta ]\\
\end{aligned}
$$
```

## A frequentist approach to parameter estimation {#ch-03-03-estimation-frequentist}



We pick up the "24/7" example again. As before, the goal is to draw inferences about the latent bias $\theta \in [0;1]$. Being a frequentist, we do that based only on likelihood function $P(k \mid \theta)$, given here by the binomial distribution as before. We will derive, from $P(k \mid \theta)$ alone, plausible point and interval estimates. There are several constructions for both point and interval estimates. We here only look at what seem to be the single most prominent exemplars in each category.

### Maximum likelihood estimate

The **maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)** is a point estimate based on the likelihood function alone. It specifies the value of $\theta$ for which the observed data is most likely. We often use the notation $\hat{\theta}$ to denote the MLE of $\theta$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \hat{\theta} = \arg \max_{\theta} P(d \mid \theta)
\end{aligned}
$$

For the binomial likelihood function, the maximum likelihood estimate is easy to calculate as $\frac{k}{N}$, yielding
$\frac{7}{24} \approx 0.292$ for the running example. Figure \@ref(fig:ch-03-03-estimation-MLE) shows a graph of the non-normalized likelihood function and indicates the maximum likelihood estimate (the value that maximizes the curve).

```{r ch-03-03-estimation-MLE, echo = F, fig.cap = "Non-normalized likelihood function for the observation of $k=7$ successes in $N=24$ flips, including maximum likelihood estimate."}
plotdata_24_7_mle <- tibble(
  theta = seq(0.01,1, by = 0.01),
  lh = dbinom(x = 7, size = 24, prob = theta)
  )
expData_27_7_mle <- tibble(
  theta = c(7/24,7/24),
  lh = c(0,dbinom(x=7,size=24,prob=7/24))
)
ggplot(plotdata_24_7_mle, aes(x = theta, y = lh)) + xlim(0,1) +
  geom_label(x = 0.52, y = dbinom(x=7,size=24,prob=7/24), label = "MLE: 0.292", color = project_colors[1], size = 5) +
  geom_line(data = expData_27_7_mle, aes(x = theta, y = lh), color = project_colors[1], size = 1.25) +
  geom_line(color = "black", size = 2) + ylab("likelihood")
```



### Confidence intervals

The most commonly used interval estimate in frequentist analyses are *confidence intervals*. Although (frequentist) confidence intervals *can* coincide with (subjectivist) credible intervals in specific cases, they generally do not. And even when confidence and credible values yield the same numerical results, these notions are fundamentally different and ought not to be confused.

Let's look at credible intervals to establish the proper contrast. Recall that part of the definition of a credible interval for a posterior distribution over $\theta$, captured here notationally in terms a random variable $\Theta$, was the probability $P(l \le \Theta \le u)$ that the value realized by random variable $\Theta$ lies in the interval $[l;u]$. This statement makes no sense to the frequentist. There cannot be any non-trivial value for $P(l \le \Theta \le u)$. The true value of $\theta$ is either in the interval $[l;u]$ or it is not. To speak of a probability that $\theta$ is in $[l;u]$ is to appeal to an ill-formed concept of probability which the frequentist denies.

In order to give an interval estimate nonetheless, the frequentist appeals to probabilities that she can accept: probabilities derived from (hypothetical) repetitions of a genuine random event with objectively observable outcomes. Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the random variable that captures the probability with which data $\mathcal{D}=D$ is realized. We obtain a pair of derived random variables $X_l$ and $X_u$ from a pair of functions $g_{l,u} \colon d \mapsto \mathbb{R}$. A **$\gamma\%$ confidence interval** for observed data $D_{\text{obs}}$ is the interval $[g_l(D_{\text{obs}}), g_u(D_{\text{obs}})]$ whenever functions $g_{l,u}$ are constructed in such a way that

$$
\begin{aligned}
  P(X_l \le \theta_{\text{true}} \le X_u) = \frac{\gamma}{100}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\theta_{\text{true}}$ is the unknown but fixed true value of $\theta$. In more intuitive words, a confidence interval is the outcome of a special construction (functions $g_{l,u}$) such that, when applying this procedure repeatedly to outcomes of the assumed data-generating process, the true value of parameter $\theta$ will lie inside of the computed confidence interval in exactly $\gamma$\% of the cases.

In some complex cases, the frequentist analyst relies on functions $g_{l}$ and $g_{u}$ that are easy to compute but only approximately satisfy the condition $P(X_l \le \theta_{\text{true}} \le X_u) = \frac{\gamma}{100}$. For example, we might use an
asymptotically correct calculation, based on the observation that, if $n$ grows to infinity, the binomial distribution approximates a normal distribution. We can then calculate a confidence interval, *as if* our binomial distribution actually was a normal distribution. If $n$ is not large enough, this will be increasingly imprecise. Rules of thumb are used to decide how big $n$ has to be to involve at best a tolerable amount of imprecision (see the Info Box below). 

For our running example ($k = 7$, $n=24$), the rule of thumb mentioned in the Info Box below recommends *not* using the asymptotic calculation. If we did nonetheless, we would get a confidence interval of $[0.110; 0.474]$. For the binomial distribution also a more reliable calculation exist, which yields $[0.126; 0.511]$ for the running example. (We can use numeric simulation to explore how good/bad a particular approximate calculation is, as shown in the next section.) The more reliable construction, the so-called *exact method*, implemented in the function `binom.confint` of R package `binom`, revolves around the close relationship between confidence intervals and $p$-values. (To foreshadow a later discussion: the exact $\gamma\%$ confidence interval is the set of all parameter values for which an exact (binomial) test does not yield a significant test result as the level of $\alpha = 1-\frac{\gamma}{100}$.)

**Aymptotic approximation of a binomial confidence interval using a normal distribution.**

Let $X$ be the random variable that determines the binomial distribution, i.e., the probability of seeing $k$ successes in $n$ flips. For large $n$, $X$ approximates a normal distribution with a mean $\mu = n \ \theta$ and a standard deviation of    $\sigma = \sqrt{n \ \theta \ (1 - \theta)}$. The random variable $U$:
$$
  U = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{X - n \  \theta}{\sqrt{n \  \theta \  (1-\theta)}}
$$
Let $\hat{P}$ be the random variable that captures the distribution of our maximum likelihood estimates for an observed outcome $k$:
$$
  \hat{P} = \frac{X}{n}
$$
Since $X = \hat{P} \  n$ we obtain:
$$
  U = \frac{\hat{P} \  n - n \  \theta}{\sqrt{n \  \theta \  (1-\theta)}}
$$
We now look at the probability that $U$ is realized to lie in a symmetric interval $[-c,c]$, centered around zero --- a probability which we require to match our confidence level:
$$
  P(-c \le U \le c) = \frac{\gamma}{100}
$$
We now expand the definition of $U$ in terms of $\hat{P}$, equate $\hat{P}$ with the current best estimate $\hat{p} = \frac{k}{n}$ based on the observed $k$ and rearrange terms, yielding the asymptotic approximation of a binomial confidence interval:
$$  
  \left [ \hat{p} - \frac{c}{n} \  \sqrt{n \  \hat{p} \  (1-\hat{p})} ; \ \ 
       \hat{p} + \frac{c}{n} \  \sqrt{n \  \hat{p} \  (1-\hat{p})} \right ]
$$
This approximation is conventionally considered precise enough when the following *rule of thumb* is met:

$$
n \ \hat{p} \ (1 - \hat{p}) > 9
$$

## Comparing Bayesian and frequentist estimates {#ch-03-03-estimation-comparison}

For Bayesians point-valued and interval-based estimates are just summary statistics to efficiently communicate about or reason with the main thing: the full posterior distribution. For the frequentist, the point-valued and interval-based estimates might be all there is. Computing a full posterior can be very hard. Computing point-estimates is usually much simpler. Yet, all the trouble of having to specify priors, and having to calculate a much more complex mathematical object, can pay off. An example which is intuitve enough is that of a likelihood function in a multi-dimensional parameter space where there is an infinite collection of parameter values that maximize the likelihood function (think of plateau). Asking a godly oracle for the (actually: an) MLE can be disastrously misleading. The full posterior will show the quirkiness.^[We will see such an example later for the case of linear regression with correlated independent variables, so-called collinearity.]

Practical issues aside, there are also conceptual arguments that can be pinned against each other. Suppose you do not know the bias of a coin, you flip it once and it lands heads. The case in mathematical notation: $k=1$, $N=1$. As a frequentist, your "best" estimate of the coin's bias is that it is 100% rigged: it will *never* land tails. As a Bayesian, with uninformed priors, your "best" estimate is, following Laplace rule, $\frac{k+1}{N+2} = \frac{2}{3}$. Notice that, apparently, there might be different notions of what counts as "best" in place. Still, the frequentist "best" estimate seems rather extreme.

What about interval-ranged estimates? Which is the better tool, confidence intervals or credible intervals? -- This is harder to answer. Numerical simulations can help answer these questions.^[Even if the math seems daunting, this method is much more tangible and applicable and requires only basic programming experience.] The idea is simple but immensely powerful. We simulate, repeatedly, a ground-truth and synthetic results for fictitious experiments, and then we apply the statistical tests/procedures to these fictitious data sets. Since we know the ground-truth, we can check which tests/procedures got it right.

Let's look at a simulation, comparing credible intervals to confidence intervals, the latter of which calculated by asymptotic approximation or the so-called exact method. To do so, we repeatedly sample a ground-truth (e.g., a known coin bias $\theta_{\text{true}}$) from a flat distribution over $[0;1]$.^[This is already not innocuous. We are fixing, as it were, an assumption about how likely ground-truths should actually occur in the real world.]. We then simulate an experiment in a synthetic world with $\theta_{\text{true}}$, using a fixed value of $n$, here taken from the set $n \in \set{10, 25, 100, 1000}$. We then construct a confidence interval (either approximately or precisely) and a 95% credible interval; for each of the three interval estimates. We check whether the ground-truth $\theta_{\text{true}}$ is *not* included in any given interval estimate. We calculate the mean number of times such non-inclusion (errors!) happen for each kind of interval estimate. The coe below implements this and the figure below shows the results, based on 10,000 samples of $\theta_{\text{true}}$.
