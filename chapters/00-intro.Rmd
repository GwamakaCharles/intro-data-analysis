# General Introduction

This chapter lays out the learning goals of this book (Section \@ref(intro-learning-goals)) and describes how these goals are to be achieved (Section \@ref(intro-course-structure)). Section \@ref(intro-tools-methods) details which technical tools and methods are covered here, and which are not.


## Learning goals {#intro-learning-goals}

At the end of this course students should:

- feel confident to pick up any data set to explore in a hypothesis-driven manner
- have gained the competence to 
  - understand complex data sets, 
  - manipulate a data set, so as to
  - plot aspects of it in ways that are useful for answering a given research question
- understand the general logic statistical inference in the frequentist and the Bayesian approach
- be able to independently evaluate statistical analyses based on their adequacy for a given research question and data set
- be able to critically assess the adequacy of analyses commonly found in the literature

Notice that this is, although a lot of hard work already, sill rather modest! It doesn't actually say that we necessarily aim at the competence to *do it* or even to *do it flawlessly*! **Our main goal is understanding**, because that is the foundation of practical success *and* the foundation of an ability to learn more in the future. **We do not teach tricks! We do not share recipes!** 

## Course structure {#intro-course-structure}

The course consists of fours parts. After given preliminaries in part I on the course and the main programming language that we will use, R, Part II on "Data" covers what is often called *descriptive statistics*. It also gives us room to learn more about R when we massage data into shape, compute summary statistics and plot various different data types in various different ways. 

Part III is the main theoretical part. It covers what is often called *inferential statistics*. Two aspects distinguish this course from the bulk of its cousins out there. First, we use a **dual-pronged approach**, i.e., we are going to introduce both the frequentist and the Bayesian approach to statistical inference side by siide. The motivation for this is that seeing the contrast between the two will aid our understanding of either one. Second, we will use a **computational approach**, i.e., we foster understanding of mathematical notions with computer simulations or other variants of helpful code.
