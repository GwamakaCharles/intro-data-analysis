## Installation issues

### Install (base) R

- Use the [cran mirror of the university of Goettingen](https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/cran/) and choose the appropriate version (Windows, Mac or Linux)
- Click on the link `install R for the first time` for downloading
- Open the downloaded file and execute installation

### Install RStudio

- additional to base R you should download [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- scroll down to the section **Installers for Supported Platforms** and choose the appropriate version
- download the file, open it and execute installation

### Install brms-package

- open RStudio (the lower left panel is the *console*)
- type in the console the following command: `install.packages("rstan", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/", dependencies = TRUE)`
- For checking the C++ Toolchain type in the console once: `pkgbuild::has_build_tools(debug = TRUE)`. If this line ultimately returns `TRUE`, then your C++ toolchain is properly installed 
  - Windows: A pop-up appears asking if you want to install Rtools. Click Yes and wait until the installation is finished.
  - Mac: A link will appear but do *not* click on it. Instead download the macOS R [toolchain installer](https://github.com/rmacoslib/r-macos-rtools/releases/tag/v3.0.0), open and execute it (if you want to now more behind read this [github site](https://github.com/rmacoslib/r-macos-rtools#how-do-i-use-the-installer))
  - Linux: go to this [github site](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Installing-RStan-on-Linux) and follow the instruction
- after installing RStan you can load the package via typing in the console `library("rstan")`
  - As the startup message says, if you are using rstan locally on a multicore machine and have plenty of RAM to estimate your model in parallel, at this point execute `options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())`. In addition, you should follow the second startup message that says to execute `rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)` which allows you to automatically save a bare version of a compiled Stan program to the hard disk so that it does not need to be recompiled (unless you change it). Finally, if you use Windows, there will be a third startup message saying to execute `Sys.setenv(LOCAL_CPPFLAGS = '-march=native')` which is *not* necessary if you followed the C++ toolchain configuration advice in the previous section.

### Install tidyverse-package

- open RStudio and type the following line into the lower left panel (*Console*): `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- wait until installation is finished and then load the package by typing in the line: `library("tidyverse")`
- you can track if the package is activated in the lower right panel (tab "Packages"): Scroll to "tidyverse", a checkmark should appear on the left

### install greta-package
