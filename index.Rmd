# Preface {-}

The book introduces key concepts of data analysis from a frequentist and a Bayesian tradition. It uses R to handle, plot and analyze data. It relies on simulation to illustrate selected statistical concepts.


## Testing / Showcasing

Don't pay too much attention to what is written here.

### Quotes

This is a quote:

> Tidy datasets [...] have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.
>
> --- @wickham2014

### Infobox

At certain stages, possibly at the end of chapters or after important concepts, we might want to use a special infobox (see `.infobox` in `styles.css`) to summarise it or give food for thought. Like this:

```{block, type='infobox'}
A horse walks into a bar and orders a pint. The barkeep says "you're in here pretty often. Think you might be an alcoholic?", to which the horse says "I don't think I am.", and vanishes from existence.

See, the joke is about Descartes' famous philosophy of 'I think therefore, I am", but to explain that part before the rest of the joke would be to put Descartes before the horse.
```

### Plots

This is a plot:

```{r plot_example_01}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(color)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue", alpha = .6) +
  theme_classic()
```
