It introduces key concepts of data analysis from a frequentist and a Bayesian tradition. It uses R to handle, plot and analyze data. It relies on simulation to illustrate selected statistical concepts. "],

["Chap-01-00-intro-learning-goals.html", "1.1 Learning goals", " 1.1 Learning goals At the end of this course students should: feel confident to pick up any data set to explore in a hypothesis-driven manner have gained the competence to understand complex data sets, manipulate a data set, so as to plot aspects of it in ways that are useful for answering a given research question understand the general logic of statistical inference in frequentist and Bayesian approach be able to independently evaluate statistical analyses based on their adequacy for a given research question and data set be able to critically assess the adequacy of analyses commonly found in the literature Notice that this is, although a lot of hard work already, sill rather modest! It doesn’t actually say that we necessarily aim at the competence to do it or even to do it flawlessly! Our main goal is understanding, because that is the foundation of practical success and the foundation of an ability to learn more in the future. We do not teach tricks! We do not share recipes! "],
["Chap-01-00-intro-course-structure.html", "1.2 Course structure", " 1.2 Course structure The course consists of fours parts. After giving a more detailed overview of the course, Part I introduces R the main programming language that we will use. Part II covers what is often called descriptive statistics. It also gives us room to learn more about R when we massage data into shape, compute summary statistics and plot various different data types in various different ways. Part III is the main theoretical part. It covers what is often called inferential statistics. Two aspects distinguish this course from the bulk of its cousins out there. First, we use a dual-pronged approach, i.e., we are going to introduce both the frequentist and the Bayesian approach to statistical inference side by side. The motivation for this is that seeing the contrast between the two approaches will aid our understanding of either one. Second, we will use a computational approach, i.e., we foster understanding of mathematical notions with computer simulations or other variants of helpful code. Part IV covers applications of what we have learned so far. It focuses on generalized linear models, a class of models that have become the new standard for analyses of experimental data in the social and psychological sciences, but are also very useful for data exploration in other domains (such as machine learning). There are also appendices with additional information: Further useful material (textbooks, manuals, etc.) is provided in Appendix A. Appendix B covers the most important probability distributions used in this book. An excursion providing more information about the important Exponential Family of probability distributions and the Maximum Entropy Principle is given in Appendix C. The data sets which reoccur throughout the book as “running examples” are succinctly summarized in Appendix D. "],
["Chap-01-00-intro-tools-methods.html", "1.3 Tools and topics covered (and not covered) here", " 1.3 Tools and topics covered (and not covered) here The main programming language used in this course is R (R Core Team 2018). We will make heavy use of the tidyverse package (Wickham 2017), which provides a unified set of functions and conventions that deviate (sometimes: substantially) from basic R. We will also be using the probabilistic programming language WebPPL (Goodman and Stuhlmüller 2014), but only “passively” in order to quickly obtain results from probabilistic calculations that we can experiment with directly in the browser. We will not learn to write WebPPL code from scratch. We will rely on the R package brms (Bürkner 2017) for running Bayesian generalized regression models, which itself relies on the probabilistic programming language Stan (Carpenter et al. 2017). We will, however, not learn about Stan in this course. Instead of Stan we will use the package greta (Golding 2019) to write our models and do inference with them. This is because, for current learning purposes, the language in which greta formulates its models is much closer to R and so, let’s hope, easier to learn. Section 1.5 gives information about how to install these, and other, tools necessary for this course. The main topics that this course will cover are: data preparation: how to clean up, and massage a data set into shape for plotting and analysis data visualization: how to select aspects of data to visualize in informative and useful ways statistical models: what that is, and why it’s beneficial to think in terms of models, not tests statistical inference: what that is, and how it’s done in frequentist and Bayesian approaches hypothesis testing: how Frequentists and Bayesians test scientific hypotheses generalized regression: how to apply GRMs to different types of data sets There is, obviously, a lot that we will not cover in this course. We will, for instance, not dwell at any length on the specifics of algorithms for computing statistical inferences or model fits. We will also deal with the history and the philosophy of science of statistics only to the extent that it helps understand the theoretical notions and practical habits that are important in the context of this course. We will also not do heavy math. Data analysis can be quite varied, because data itself can be quite varied. We try to sample some variation, but since this is an introductory course with lots of other ground to cover, we will be slightly conservative in the kind of data that we analyze. There will, for example, not be any pictures, sounds, dates or time points in any of the material covered here. There are at least two different motivations for data analysis, and it is important to keep them apart. This course focues on data analysis for explanation, i.e., routines that help us understand reality through the inspection and massaging of empirical data. We will only glance at the alternative approach, which is data analysis for prediction, i.e., using models to predict future observations, as commonly practiced in machine learning and its applications. In sloppy slogan form, this course treats data science for scientific knowledge gain, not the engineers’ applications. References "],
["Chap-01-00-intro-data-sets.html", "1.4 Data sets covers", " 1.4 Data sets covers We want to learn how to do data analysis. This is impossible without laying hands (keys?) on several data sets. But switching from one data set to another is mentally taxing. It is also difficult to focus and really care about any-old data set. This is why this course relies on a small selection of recurring data sets that are, hopefully, generally interesting for the target audience: students of cognitive science. Appendix D gives an overview of the most important, recurring data sets used in this course. Most of the data sets that we will use repeatedly in this class come from various psychological experiments. To make this even more emersive, these experiments are implemented as browser-based experiments, using _magpie. This makes it possible for students of this course to do the exact experiments whose data we are analyzing (and maybe generate some more intuitions, maybe generate some hypotheses) about the very data at hand. But it also makes it possible that we will analyze ourselves. That’s why part of the exercises for this course will run additional analyses on data collected from the aspiring data analysts themselves. If you want to become an analyst, you should also have undergone analysis yourself, so to speak. "],
["Chap-01-00-intro-installation.html", "1.5 Installation", " 1.5 Installation This course relies on a few different pieces of software. Primarily, we’ll be using R, but we’ll need installations of Python and C++ in the background. There are two options for installing. The simplest method, described in Section 1.5.1 is to install VirtualBox and use our provided Ubuntu virtual machine (link provided in class), which has the required software pre-installed and tested. When using this method, you will be working in an virtualized Linux environment. Alternatively, you can go through a manual installation tailored to your own OS, as described in Section 1.5.2. Manual installation is recommended if you do not wish to use a virtualized Linux environment. The VirtualBox method can be a fall-back option if manual installation fails. Both methods of installation are detailed below. Finally, Section 1.5.2 explains how to update the R package that wraps all R packages needed for this course and provides some extra conenience functions. 1.5.1 VirtualBox Setup 1.5.1.1 Step 1. Install VirtualBox Follow the instructions here to download and install for your platform. 1.5.1.2 Step 2. Download our Ubuntu image Download the provided VirtualBox Disk Image and move it into a folder such as “VMs”. The link for the VirtualBox Disk Image is provided on StudIP. 1.5.1.3 Step 3. Create a new virtual machine and add the downloaded image Open VirtualBox and click New Give your new virtual machine a name, e.g. “IDA2019” Change the Machine Folder to the folder where you put the disk image Change the Type to “Linux” and Version to “Ubuntu (64-bit)” and click Next to proceed to memory allocation Allocate about half of your available memory and click Next to proceed to hard disk selection Choose “Use an existing virtual hard disk file” and use the file selection icon to add our provided disk image Click Create 1.5.1.4 Step 4. Give your virtual machine more processing power Select your virtual machine on the right panel and click Settings on the top Navigate to System -&gt; Processor Increase the Processor(s) to about half of what your computer can provide 1.5.1.5 Step 5. Boot your virtual machine Select your virtual machine and click Start The username of the system is “user” and the password is “password” 1.5.1.6 Step 6. Install further packages The virtual machine includes most of the packages required, but not all. First, run the following command in ‘Terminal’: sudo apt install r-cran-devtools r-cran-boot r-cran-extradistr r-cran-ggsignif r-cran-naniar Then, open RStudio and run the following command in the R console: devtools::install_github(&quot;n-kall/IDA2019-package&quot;) 1.5.1.7 Troubleshooting If the virtual machine does not boot, you may need to ensure that ‘virtualization’ is enabled in your computer’s BIOS. Talk to a tutor if you’re having difficulties doing so. 1.5.2 Manual installation If you don’t want to use the virtual machine, or it doesn’t work for you, the following six steps describe how to get the main components installed manually. Depending on your operating system (e.g. macOS, Linux, Windows), you might need to follow slightly different instructions, which are specified. Depending on the exact setup of your computer, the results may vary. The virtual machine has been tested with the required software, so if you can, we recommend using that. 1.5.2.1 Step 1. Install Python Windows and macOS: We recommend installing miniconda from here Linux: You can install miniconda or you can just use the preinstalled Python (which saves time and space). Make sure you have pip installed, e.g. for Ubuntu apt install python3-pip 1.5.2.2 Step 2. Install the required Python packages We have provided files that list the required Python packages. They can be installed automatically with the following commands in the terminal. For Anaconda: Download this enviroment file conda env create -f environment.yml For Linux users who are using pip: Download this requirements file pip3 install -r requirements.txt 1.5.2.3 Step 3. Install R Windows and macOS: Download and install R from here Linux users: We need to have at least version 3.5 of R. This may be available in your distribution’s repository. e.g. if you are using a recent version of Ubuntu (18.10 or later), you can install R with apt install r-base. Otherwise, follow these instructions for your version. 1.5.2.4 Step 4. Install RStudio All platforms: Download and install the latest version of RStudio from here 1.5.2.5 Step 5. Install a C++ toolchain For the Stan language, which will be interfaced through an R package called brms, you’ll need a working C++ compiler. Windows: Download and install the latest version of RTools from here macOS: Download and install the latest version of RTools for macOS from here Note: you may need to register for an Apple Developer account (free of charge). Linux (e.g. Ubuntu): You can install a compiler and toolchain with apt install build-essential. 1.5.2.6 Step 6. Install R packages We have created an R package that, when installed, will prompt the installation of the packages we will use in this course. In this step, you’ll install this package (and automatically install its dependencies). For Windows and macOS: Open RStudio and run the following two commands in the console. install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;n-kall/IDA2019-package&quot;) For Linux (e.g. Ubuntu): It’s much faster (and less error-prone) if you install devtools from the app repository via terminal: apt install r-cran-devtools and continue to the second line in the R console. But this will only work if you are using a recent version of Ubuntu (18.10 or later). If you had to manually update your R to version in step 3, you’ll need to install the following from terminal: apt install libssl-dev libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev and then install via the the R console: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;n-kall/IDA2019-package&quot;) 1.5.3 Updating the course package Occasionally, we might have to add packages or functionality as we go through this course. In that case, you will have to update the package IDA2019-package that ships all of this for this course. To update, use: devtools::install_github(&quot;n-kall/IDA2019-package&quot;) "],
["Chap-01-01-R.html", "2 Basics of R", " 2 Basics of R R is a specialized programming language for data science. Though old, it is heavily supported by an active community. New tools for data handling, visualization, and statistical analysis are provided in the form of packages.1 While other programming languages specialized for scientific computing, like Python of Julia, also lend themselves beautifully for data analysis, the choice of R in this course is motivated because R’s raison d’être is data analysis. Some of the R packages that this course will use provide cutting-edge methods which are not as conveniently available in other programming languages (yet). In a manner of speaking, there are two flavors of R. We should distinguish base R from the tidyverse. Base R is what you have when you do not load any packages. We enter the tidyverse by loading the package tidyverse (see below for information on how to do that). The tidyverse consists of several components (which are actually stand-alone packages that can be loaded separately if needed) all of which supply extra functionality for data analysis, based on a unifying philosophy and representation format. While eventually interchangable, the look-and-feel of base R and the tidyverse is quite different. Figure 2.1 lists a selection of packages from the tidyverse in relation to their role at different stages of the process of data analysis. The image is taken from this introduction to the tidyverse. Figure 2.1: Overview of selected packages from the tidyverse. The course will also introduce Rmarkdown in Section 2.5. Rmarkdown is a nice way of documenting your data analyes in a reproducible form. Participants will use Rmarkdown to prepare their homework assignments. Make sure to have completely installed everything of relevance for this course, as described in Section 1.5. Unless you have strong opinions or an unassailable favorite, we recommend trying RStudio as an IDE for R. The official documentation for base R is An Introduction to R. The standard reference for using the tidyverse is R for Data Science (R4DS). There are some very useful cheat sheets which you should definitely check out! There are pointers to further material in Appendix A.1. The learning goals for this chapter are: become familiar with R, its syntax and basic notions become familiar with the key functionality from the tidyverse understand and write simple R scripts be able to write documents in Rmarkdown Packages live in the official package repository CRAN, or are supplied in less standardized forms, e.g., via open repositories, such as GitHub.↩ "],
["ch1-first-steps.html", "2.1 First steps", " 2.1 First steps R is an interpreted language. This means that you do not have to compile it. You can just evaluate it line by line, in a so-called session. The session stores the current values of all variables. If you do not want to retype, you can store your code in a script.2 Try this out by either typing r to open an R session in a terminal or load RStudio.3 You can immediately calculate stuff: 6 * 7 ## [1] 42 2.1.1 Functions R has many built-in functions. The most common situation is that the function is called by its name using prefix notation, followed by round brackets which enclose the function’s arguments (separated by commata if multiple). For example, the function round takes a number and, per default, returns the closest integer: ## the function `round` takes a number as argument and ## returns the closest integer (default) round(0.6) ## [1] 1 Actually, round allows several arguments. It takes as input the number x to be rounded, and another integer number digits which gives the number of digits after the comma to which x should be rounded. We can then specify these arguments in a function call of round by providing the named arguments. ## rounds the number `x` to the number `digits` of digits round(x = 0.138, digits = 2) ## [1] 0.14 When providing all arguments with names, the order of arguments does not matter. When providing at least one non-named argument, all non-named arguments have to be presented in the right order (as expected by the function; to find out what that is use help, as explained below in 2.1.6) after subtracting the named arguments from the ordered list of arguments. round(x = 0.138, digits = 2) # works as intended round(digits = 2, x = 0.138) # works as intended round(0.138, digits = 2) # works as intended round(0.138, 2) # works as intended round(x = 0.138, 2) # works as intended round(digits = 2, 0.138) # works as intended round(2, x = 0.138) # works as intended round(2, 0.138) # does not work as intended (returns 2) Functions can have default values for some or all of their arguments. In the case of round the default is digits = 0. There is obviously no default for x in the function round. Some functions can take an arbitrary number of arguments. The function sum, which sums up numbers is a point in case. ## adds all of its arguments together sum(1,2,3) ## [1] 6 Selected functions can also be called in infix notation. This applies to frequently recurring operations, such as mathematical operations or logical comparisons. ## both of these calls sum 1, 2, and 3 together sum(1,2,3) # prefix notation 1 + 2 + 3 # prefix notation Section 2.3 will list some of the most important built-in functions. It will also explain how to define your own functions. 2.1.2 Variables You can assign values to variables using three assignment operators: -&gt;, &lt;- and =, like so: x &lt;- 6 7 -&gt; y z = 3 x * y / z ## [1] 14 Use of = is discouraged.4 It is good practice to use a consistent naming scheme for variables. This book uses snake_case_variable_names and tends towards using long_and_excessively_informative_names for important variables, and short variable names, like i, j or x, for local variables, indices etc. 2.1.3 Literate coding It is good practice to document code with short but informative comments. Comments in R are demarcated with #. x &lt;- 4711 # a nice number from Cologne Since everything on a line after an occurrence of # is treated as a comment, it is possible to break long function calls across several lines, and to add comments to each line: round( # call the function `round` x = 0.138, # number to be rounded digits = 2 # number of after-comma digits to round to ) In RStudio, you can use Command+Shift+C (on Mac) and Ctrl+Shift+C (on Windows/Linux) to comment or uncomment code, and you can use comments to structure your scripts. Any comment followed by ---- is treated as a (foldable) section. # SECTION: variable assignments ---- x &lt;- 6 y &lt;- 7 # SECTION: some calculations ---- x * y 2.1.4 Objects Strictly speaking, all entities in R are objects but that is not always apparent or important for everyday practical purposes see the manual for more information. R supports an object-oriented programming style, but we will not make (explicit) use of this functionality. In fact, this course heavily uses and encourages a functional programming style (see Section 2.4). Some functions (e.g., optimizers or fitting functions for statistical models) return objects, however, and we will use this output in various ways. For example, if we run a linear regression model on some data set, the output is an object. ## you do not need to understand this code model_fit = lm(formula = speed~dist, data = cars) ## just notice that the function `lm` returns an object is.object(model_fit) ## [1] TRUE ## printing an object on the screen usually gives you summary information print(model_fit) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = speed ~ dist, data = cars) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) dist ## 8.2839 0.1656 2.1.5 Packages Much of R’s charm unfolds through the use of packages. CRAN has the official package repository. To install a new package from a CRAN mirror use the install.packages function. For example, to install the package devtools, you would use: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) Once installed, you need to load your desired packages for each fresh session, using: library(devtools) Once loaded all functions, data etc. that ship with a package are available without additional reference to the package name. If you want to be careful or curteous to an admirer of your code, you can reference the package a function comes from explicitly. For example, the following code calls the function install_github from the package devtools explicitly (so that you would not need to load the package beforehand, for example): devtools::install_github(&quot;SOME-URL&quot;) Indeed, the install_github function allows you to install bleeding-edge packages from github. You can install all of the relevant packages using (after installing the devtools package, as described in Section 1.5: devtools::install_github(&quot;n-kall/IDA2019-package&quot;) After this installation, you can load all packages for this course simply by using: library(IDA2019) In RStudio, there is a special tab in the pane with informtion on “files”, “plots” etc. to show all installed packages. This also shows which packages are currently loaded. 2.1.6 Getting help If you encounter a function like lm that you do not know about, you can access its documentation with the help function or just typing ?lm. Ror example, the following call summons the documentation for lm, the first parts are shown in Figure 2.2. help(lm) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;visuals/R-doc-example.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Excerpt from the documentation of the lm function. If you are looking for help on a more general topic, use the function help.search. It takes a regular expression as input and outputs a list of occurrences in the available documentation. A useful shortcut for help.search is just to type ?? followed by the (unquoted) string to search for. For example, calling either of the following lines might produce a display like in Figure 2.3. ## two equivalent ways for obtaining help on search term &#39;linear&#39; help.search(&quot;linear&quot;) ??linear knitr::include_graphics(&quot;visuals/R-doc-search-example.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Result of calling help.search for the term ‘linear’. The top entries in Figure 2.3 are vignettes. These are compact manuals or tutorial on particular topics or functions, and they are directly available in R. If you want to browse through the vignettes available on your machine (which depend on which packages you have installed), go ahead: browseVignettes() Line-by-line execution of code is useful for quick development and debugging. Make sure to learn about keyboard shortcuts to execute single lines or chunks of code in your favorite editor, e.g., check the RStudio Cheat Sheet for information on its keyboard shortcuts.↩ When starting a session in a terminal, you can exit a running R session by typing quit() or q().↩ You can produce &lt;- in RStudio with Option-- (on Mac) and Alt-- (on Windows/Linux). For other useful keyboard shortcuts, see here.↩ "],
["ch1-data-types.html", "2.2 Data types", " 2.2 Data types Let’s briefly go through the data types that are most important for our later purposes. We can assess the type of an object stored in variable x with the function typeof(x). typeof(3) ## returns type &quot;double&quot; typeof(TRUE) ## returns type &quot;logical&quot; typeof(cars) ## returns &#39;list&#39; (includes data.frames, tibbles, objects, ...) typeof(&quot;huhu&quot;) ## return &#39;character&quot; (= string) typeof(mean) ## return &#39;closure&quot; (= function) typeof(c) ## return &#39;builtin&quot; (= deep system internal stuff) typeof(round) ## returns type &quot;special&quot; (= well, special stuff?) To learn more about an object, it can help to just print it out as a string: str(lm) ## function (formula, data, subset, weights, na.action, method = &quot;qr&quot;, ## model = TRUE, x = FALSE, y = FALSE, qr = TRUE, singular.ok = TRUE, ## contrasts = NULL, offset, ...) It is sometimes possible to cast objects of one type into another type XXX using functions as.XXX in base R or as_XXX in the tidyverse. ## casting Boolean value `TRUE` into number format as.numeric(TRUE) ## [1] 1 R is essentially an array-based language. Arrays are arbitrary but finite dimensional matrices. We will discuss what is usually referred to as vectors (= one-dimensional arrays), matrices (= two-dimensional arrays) and arrays (= more-than-two-dimensional) in the following section on numeric information. But it is important to keep in mind that arrays can contain objects of other types than numeric information (as long as all objects in the array are of the same type). 2.2.1 Numeric vectors &amp; matrices 2.2.1.1 Numeric information Standard number format in R is double. typeof(3) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; We can also represent numbers as integers and complex. typeof(as.integer(3)) # returns &#39;integer&#39; ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; typeof(as.complex(3)) # returns &#39;complex&#39; ## [1] &quot;complex&quot; 2.2.1.2 Numeric vectors As a generally useful heuristic, expect every numerical information to be treated as a vector (or higher-order: matrix, array, … ; see below), and to expect any (basic, mathematical) operation in R to (most likely) apply to the whole vector, matrix, array, collection.5 This makes it possible to ask for the length of a variable to which we assing a single number, for instance: x &lt;- 7 length(x) ## [1] 1 We can even index such a variable: x &lt;- 7 x[1] ## what is the entry in position 1 of the vector x? ## [1] 7 Or assign a new value to a hitherto unused index: x[3] &lt;- 6 ## assign the value 6 to the 3rd entry of vector x x ## notice that the 2nd entry is undefined, or &quot;NA&quot;, not available ## [1] 7 NA 6 Vectors in general can be declared with the built-in function c(). To memorize this, think of concatenation or combination. x &lt;- c(4, 7, 1, 1) # this is now a 4-place vector x ## [1] 4 7 1 1 There are also helpful functions to generate sequences of numbers: 1:10 ## returns 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1) ## returns 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 0.5) ## returns 1, 1.5, 2, ..., 9.5, 10 seq(from = 0, to = 1 , length.out = 11) ## returns 0, 0.1, ..., 0.9, 1 Indexing in R starts with 1, not 0! x &lt;- c(4, 7, 1, 1) # this is now a 4-place vector x[2] ## [1] 7 And now we see what is meant above when we said that (almost) every mathematical operation can be expected to apply to a vector: x &lt;- c(4, 7, 1, 1) # 4-placed vector as before x + 1 ## [1] 5 8 2 2 2.2.1.3 Numeric matrices Matrices are declared with the function matrix. This function takes, for instance, a vector as an argument. x &lt;- c(4, 7, 1, 1) # 4-placed vector as before (m &lt;- matrix(x)) # cast x into matrix format ## [,1] ## [1,] 4 ## [2,] 7 ## [3,] 1 ## [4,] 1 Notice that the result is a matrix with a single column. This is important. R uses so-called column-major mode.6 This means that it will fill columns first. For example, a matrix with three columns based on a six-placed vector \\(1, 2, \\dots, 6\\) will be built by filling the first column from top to bottom, then the second column top to bottom, and so on.7 m &lt;- matrix(1:6, ncol = 3) m ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1 3 5 ## [2,] 2 4 6 In line with column-major mode, vectors are treated as column vectors in matrix operations: x = c(1,0,1) ## 3-place vector m %*% x ## dot product with previous matrix &#39;m&#39; ## [,1] ## [1,] 6 ## [2,] 8 As usual, and independently of column- or row-major mode, matrix indexing starts with the row index: m[1,] ## produces first row of matrix &#39;m&#39; ## [1] 1 3 5 2.2.1.4 Arrays Arrays are simply higher-dimensional matrices. We will not make use of arrays in this course. 2.2.1.5 Names for vectors, matrices and arrays The positions in a vector can be given names. This is extremely useful for good “literate coding” and therefore highly recommended. The names of vector x’s positions are retrieved and set by the names function: students &lt;- c(&quot;Jax&quot;, &quot;Jamie&quot;, &quot;Jason&quot;) # names of students grades &lt;- c(1.3, 2.7, 2.0) # a vector of grades names(grades) # retrieve names: with no nanmes so far ## NULL names(grades) &lt;- students # assign names names(grades) # retrieve names again: names assigned ## [1] &quot;Jax&quot; &quot;Jamie&quot; &quot;Jason&quot; grades # output shows names ## Jax Jamie Jason ## 1.3 2.7 2.0 We can also set the names of a vector directly during construction:8 ## names of students (this is a character vector, see below) students &lt;- c(&quot;Jax&quot;, &quot;Jamie&quot;, &quot;Jason&quot;) ## constructing a vector with names directly assigned grades &lt;- c(1.3, 2.7, 2.0, names = students) Names for matrices are retrieved or set with functions rownames and colnames. ## declare matrix m &lt;- matrix(1:6, ncol = 3) ## assign row and column names, using function ## `str_c` which is described below rownames(m) &lt;- str_c(&quot;row&quot;, 1:nrow(m), sep = &quot;_&quot;) colnames(m) &lt;- str_c(&quot;col&quot;, 1:ncol(m), sep = &quot;_&quot;) m ## col_1 col_2 col_3 ## row_1 1 3 5 ## row_2 2 4 6 2.2.2 Booleans There are built-in names for Boolean values “true” and “false”, predictably named TRUE and FALSE. Equivalent shortcuts are T and F. If we attempt to do math with Boolean vectors, the outcome is what any reasonable logician would expect: x = c(T,F,T) 1 - x ## [1] 0 1 0 x + 3 ## [1] 4 3 4 Boolean vectors can be used as index sets to extract elements from other vectors. # vector 1, 2, ..., 5 number_vector = 1:5 # index of odd numbers set to `TRUE` boolean_vector = c(T,F,T,F,T) ## returns the elemnts from number vector, for which ## the corresponding element in the Boolean vector is true number_vector[boolean_vector] ## [1] 1 3 5 2.2.3 Special values There are a couple of keywords reserved in R for special kinds of objects: NA: “not availables”; represents missing values in data NaN: “not a number”; e.g., division zero by zero Inf or -Inf: infinity and negative infinity; returned when number is too big or devision by zero NULL: the NULL object; often returned when function is undefined for input 2.2.4 Characters (= strings) Strings are called characters in R. We will be stubborn and call them strings for most of the time here. We can assign a string value to a variable by putting the string in double quotes: x &lt;- &quot;huhu&quot; typeof(x) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; We can create vectors of characters in the obvious way: chr_vector = c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) chr_vector ## [1] &quot;huhu&quot; &quot;hello&quot; &quot;huhu&quot; &quot;ciao&quot; The package stringr from the tidyverse also provides very useful and, in comparison to base R, more uniform functions for string manipulation. The cheat sheet for the stingr package is highly recommended for a quick overview. Below are some examples. Function str_c concatenates strings: str_c(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Hi&quot;, &quot;Hey&quot;, sep = &quot;! &quot;) ## [1] &quot;Hello! Hi! Hey&quot; We can find the indeces of matches in a character vector with str_which: chr_vector = c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) str_which(chr_vector, &quot;hu&quot;) ## [1] 1 3 Similarly, str_detect gives a Boolean vector of matching: chr_vector = c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) str_detect(chr_vector, &quot;hu&quot;) ## [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE If we want to get the strings matching a pattern, we can use str_subset: chr_vector = c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) str_subset(chr_vector, &quot;hu&quot;) ## [1] &quot;huhu&quot; &quot;huhu&quot; Replacing all matches with another string works with str_replace_all: chr_vector = c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;) str_replace_all(chr_vector, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) ## [1] &quot;BuBu&quot; &quot;Bello&quot; &quot;BuBu&quot; &quot;ciao&quot; For data preparation we often need to split strings by a particular character. For instance, a set of reaction times could be separated by a character line “|”. We can split this string representation to get individual measurements like so: ## three measures of reaction time in a single string reaction_times = &quot;123|234|345&quot; ## notice that we need to doubly (!) escape character | ## notice also that the results is a list (see below) str_split(reaction_times, &quot;\\\\|&quot;, n = 3) ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;123&quot; &quot;234&quot; &quot;345&quot; 2.2.5 Factors factors track levels factor(chr_vector) ## [1] huhu hello huhu ciao ## Levels: ciao hello huhu ordered factors arrange their levels factor(chr_vector, ordered = T, levels = c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;, &quot;hello&quot;)) ## [1] huhu hello huhu ciao ## Levels: huhu &lt; ciao &lt; hello 2.2.6 Lists, data frames &amp; tibbles lists are key-value pairs my_list = list(dudu = 1, chacha = c(&quot;huhu&quot;, &quot;ciao&quot;)) data frames as lists of same-length vectors exp_data = data.frame( trial = 1:5, condition = factor(c(&quot;C1&quot;, &quot;C2&quot;, &quot;C1&quot;, &quot;C3&quot;, &quot;C2&quot;), ordered = T), response = c(121, 133, 119, 102, 156)) exp_data ## trial condition response ## 1 1 C1 121 ## 2 2 C2 133 ## 3 3 C1 119 ## 4 4 C3 102 ## 5 5 C2 156 access columns exp_data$condition ## [1] C1 C2 C1 C3 C2 ## Levels: C1 &lt; C2 &lt; C3 access rows exp_data[3,] ## trial condition response ## 3 3 C1 119 tibbles are data frames in the tidyverse as_tibble(exp_data) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## trial condition response ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 C1 121 ## 2 2 C2 133 ## 3 3 C1 119 ## 4 4 C3 102 ## 5 5 C2 156 tibbles do but data frames don’t allow for dynamic construction: some differences my_tibble = tibble(x = 1:10, y = x^2) ## dynamic construction possible my_dataframe = data.frame(x = 1:10, y = x^2) ## ERROR :/ If you are familiar with Python’s scipy and numpy packages, this is R’s default mode of treating numerical information.↩ Python, on the other hand, uses the reverse row-major mode.↩ It is in this sense that the “first index moves fastest” in column-major mode, which is another frequently given explanation of column-major mode.↩ Notice that we can create strings (actually called ‘characters’ in R) with double quotes↩ "],

These measures of confidence can be used for parameter inference, too. We will discuss parameter inference at length in Section ??. In this course, we will not use bootstrapping as an alternative approach to parameter inference. We will, however, follow a common practice (at least in some areas of Cognitive Psychology) to use bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of the mean as part of descriptive statistics, i.e., in summaries and plots of the data. The bootstrap is a method from a more general class of algorithms, namely so-called resampling methods. The general idea is, roughly put, that we treat the data at hand as the true representation of reality. We then imagine that we run an experiment on that (restricted, hypothetical) reality. We then ask ourselves: what would we estimate (e.g., as a mean) in any such hypothetical experiment. The more these hypothetical measures derived from hypothetical experiments based on a hypthetical reality differ, the less confident we are in the estimate. Sounds weird, but is mindblowingly elegant. An algorithm for constructing a 95% confidence interval of the mean of vector \\(D\\) of numeric data with length \\(k\\) looks as follows: take \\(k\\) samples from \\(D\\) with replacement, call this \\(D^{\\textrm{rep}}\\)9 calculate the mean \\(\\mu(D^{\\textrm{rep}})\\) of the newly sampled data repeat steps 1 and 2 to gather \\(r\\) means of different resamples of \\(D\\); call the result vector \\(\\mu_{\\textrm{sampled}}\\) the boundaries of the 95% inner quantile of \\(\\mu_{\\textrm{sampled}}\\) are the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval of the mean The higher \\(r\\), i.e., the more samples we take, the better the estimate. The higher \\(k\\), i.e., the more observations we have to begin with, the less variable the means \\(\\mu(D^{\\textrm{rep}})\\) of the resampled data will usually be. Hence, usually, the higher \\(k\\) the smaller the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval of the mean. Here is a convenience function that we will use throughout the book to produce bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of the mean: ## takes a vector of numbers and returns bootstrapped 95% ConfInt ## for the mean, based on `n_resamples` re-samples (default: 1000) bootstrapped_CI &lt;- function(data_vector, n_resamples = 1000) { resampled_means &lt;- map_dbl(1:n_resamples, function(i) { mean(sample(x = data_vector, size = length(data_vector), replace = T) ) } ) tibble( &#39;lower&#39; = quantile(resampled_means, 0.025), &#39;mean&#39; = mean(data_vector), &#39;upper&#39; = quantile(resampled_means, 0.975) ) } Applying this method to the vector of reaction times from above we get: bootstrapped_CI(RT) ## # A tibble: 1 x 3 ## lower mean upper ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 5.72 5.73 5.74 Notice that, since RT has length 3980, i.e., we have \\(k = 3980\\) observations in the data, the bootstrapped 95% confidence interval is rather narrow. Compare this against a case of \\(k = 30\\): # 30 samples from a standard normal smaller_data = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 0, sd = 1) bootstrapped_CI(smaller_data) ## # A tibble: 1 x 3 ## lower mean upper ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 -0.349 0.0274 0.396 To obtain summary statistics for different groups of a variable, we can use the function bootstrapped_CI conveniently in concert with nested tibbles, as demonstrated here on the Mental Chronometry data set (see Appendix D.1: mc_data_cleaned = read_csv(&quot;data_sets/mental-chrono-data_cleaned.csv&quot;) mc_data_cleaned %&gt;% group_by(block) %&gt;% nest() %&gt;% summarise( CIs = map(data, function(d) bootstrapped_CI(d$RT)) ) %&gt;% unnest(CIs) ## # A tibble: 3 x 4 ## block lower mean upper ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 discrimination 480. 488. 495. ## 2 goNoGo 420. 427. 434. ## 3 reaction 296. 300. 304. \\(D^{\\textrm{rep}}\\) is short for “repeated Data”. We will use this concept more later on. The idea is that we consider “hypothetical data” which we have not perceived, but which we might have. Repeated data is (usually) of the same shape and form as the original, observed data, which is also sometimes noted as \\(D^{\\textrm{obs}}\\) for clarity in comparison to \\(D^{\\textrm{rep}}\\).↩ "],

["probability.html", "7.1 Probability", " 7.1 Probability 7.1.1 Outcomes, events, observations We are interested in the space \\(\\Omega\\) of all elementary outcome \\(\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\dots\\) of a process or event whose execution is (partially) random or unknown. Elementary outcomes are mutually exclusive. The set \\(\\Omega\\) exhausts all possibilities.10 Example. The set of elementary outcomes of a single coin flip is \\(\\Omega_{\\text{coin flip}} = \\left \\{ \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\right \\}\\). The elementary outcomes of tossing a six-sided die is \\(\\Omega_{\\text{standard die}} = \\{\\) ⚀, ⚁, ⚂, ⚃, ⚄, ⚅ \\(\\}\\).11 An event \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(\\Omega\\). Think of an event as a (possibly partial) observation. We might observe, for instance, not the full outcome of tossing a die, but only that there is a dot in the middle. This would correspond to the event \\(A = \\{\\) ⚀, ⚂, ⚄ \\(\\}\\), i.e., observing an odd numbered outcome. The trivial observation \\(A = \\Omega\\) and the impossible observation \\(A = \\emptyset\\) are counted as events, too. The latter is included for technical reasons. For any two events \\(A, B \\subseteq \\Omega\\), standard set operations correspond to logical connectives in the usual way. For example, the conjunction \\(A \\cap B\\) is the observation of both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\); the disjunction \\(A \\cup B\\) is the observation that it is either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\); the negation of \\(A\\), \\(\\overline{A} = \\left \\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid \\omega \\not \\in A \\right \\}\\), is the observation that it is not \\(A\\). 7.1.2 Probability distributions A probability distribution \\(P\\) over \\(\\Omega\\) is a function \\(P \\ \\colon \\ \\mathfrak{P}(\\Omega) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) that assigns to all events \\(A \\subseteq \\Omega\\) a real number (from the unit interval, see A1 below), such that the following (so-called Kolmogorov axioms) are satisfied: A1. \\(0 \\le P(A) \\le 1\\) A2. \\(P(\\Omega) = 1\\) A3. $P(A_1 A_2 A_3 ) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) + $ whenever \\(A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots\\) are mutually exclusive12 Occasionally we encounter notation \\(P \\in \\Delta(\\Omega)\\) to express that \\(P\\) is a probability distribution over \\(\\Omega\\). (E.g., in physics, theoretical economics or game theory. Less so in psychology or statistics.) If \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\) is an elementary event, we often write \\(P(\\omega)\\) as a shorthand for \\(P(\\left \\{ \\omega \\right \\})\\). In fact, if \\(\\Omega\\) is finite, it suffices to assign probabilities to elementary outcomes. A number of rules follow immediately from of this definition (prove this!): C1. \\(P(\\emptyset) = 0\\) C2. \\(P(\\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A)\\) C3. \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\) for any \\(A, B \\subseteq \\Omega\\) 7.1.3 Interpretations of probability It is reasonably safe, at least preliminarily, to think of probability, as defined above, as a handy mathematical primitive which is useful for certain applications. There are at least three ways of thinking about where this primitive probability might come from, roughly paraphrasable like so: Frequentist: Probabilities are generalizations of intuitions/facts about frequencies of events in repeated executions of a random event. Subjectivist: Probabilities are subjective beliefs by a rational agent who is uncertain about the outcome of a random event. Realist: Probabilities are a property of an intrinsically random world. 7.1.4 Urns and frequencies Think of an urn as a container which contains a number of \\(N &gt; 1\\) balls. Balls can be of different color. For example, let us suppose that our urn has \\(k &gt; 0\\) black balls and \\(N-k\\) white balls. (There is at least one black and one white ball.) For a single random draw from our urn we have: \\(\\Omega_{\\text{our urn}} = \\left \\{ \\text{white}, \\text{black} \\right \\}\\). If we imagine an infinite sequence of single draws from our urn, putting whichever ball we drew back in after every draw, the limiting proportion with which we draw a black ball is \\(\\frac{k}{N}\\). (If in doubt, execute this experiment. By hand or by computer.) This statement about frequency is what motivates saying that the probability of drawing a black ball on a single trial is (or should be13) \\(P(\\text{black}) = \\frac{k}{N}\\). For simplicity of exposure, we gloss over subtleties arising when dealing with infinite sets \\(\\Omega\\). We make up for this when we define probability density functions for continuous random variables, which is all the uncountable infinity that we will usually be concerned with in applied statistics.↩ Think of \\(\\Omega\\) as a partition of the space of all possible ways in which the world could be, where we lump together into one partition cell all ways in which the world could be that are equivalent regarding those aspects of reality that we are interested in. We do not care whether the coin lands in the mud or in the sand. It only matters whether it came up heads or tails. Each elementary event can be realized in myriad ways. \\(\\Omega\\) is our, the modellers’, first crude simplification of nature, abstracting away aspects we currently do not care about.↩ A3 is the axiom of countable additivity. Finite additivity may be enough for finite or countable sets \\(\\Omega\\), but infinite additivity is necessary for full generality in the uncountable case.↩ If probabilities are subjective beliefs, a rational agent is, in a sense, normatively required to assign exactly this probability.↩ "],
["structured-events-marginal-distributions.html", "7.2 Structured events &amp; marginal distributions", " 7.2 Structured events &amp; marginal distributions 7.2.1 Probability table for a flip-&amp;-draw scenario Suppose we have two urns. Both have \\(N=10\\) balls. Urn 1 has \\(k_1=2\\) black and \\(N-k_1 = 8\\) white balls. Urn 2 has \\(k_2=4\\) black and \\(N-k_2=6\\) white balls. We sometimes draw from urn 1, sometimes from urn 2. To decide, we flip a fair coin. If it comes up heads, we draw from urn 1; if it comes up tails, we draw from urn 2. An elementary outcome of this two-step process of flip-&amp;-draw is a pair \\(\\langle \\text{outcome-flip}, \\text{outcome-draw} \\rangle\\). The set of all possible such outcomes is: \\[\\Omega_{\\text{flip-&amp;-draw}} = \\left \\{ \\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{black} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{white} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{tails}, \\text{black} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{tails}, \\text{white} \\rangle \\right \\}\\,.\\] The probability of event \\(\\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{black} \\rangle\\) is given by multiplying the probability of seeing “heads” on the first flip, which happens with probability \\(0.5\\), and then drawing a black ball, which happens with probability \\(0.2\\), so that \\(P(\\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{black} \\rangle) = 0.5 \\times 0.2 = 0.1\\). The probability distribution over \\(\\Omega_{\\text{flip-draw}}\\) is consequently as in Table 7.1. (If in doubt, start flipping &amp; drawing and count your outcomes.) Table 7.1: Joint probability table for the flip-&amp;-draw scenario heads tails black \\(0.5 \\times 0.2 = 0.1\\) \\(0.5 \\times 0.4 = 0.2\\) white \\(0.5 \\times 0.8 = 0.4\\) \\(0.5 \\times 0.6 = 0.3\\) 7.2.2 Structured events and joint-probability distributions Table 7.1 is an example of a joint probability distribution over a structured event space, which here has two dimensions. Since our space of outcomes is the Cartesian product of two simpler outcome spaces, namely \\(\\Omega_{flip-\\&amp;-draw} = \\Omega_{flip} \\times \\Omega_{draw}\\),14 we can use notation \\(P(\\text{heads}, \\text{black})\\) as shorthand for \\(P(\\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{black} \\rangle)\\). More generally, if \\(\\Omega = \\Omega_1 \\times \\dots \\Omega_n\\), we can think of \\(P \\in \\Delta(\\Omega)\\) as a joint probability distribution over \\(n\\) subspaces. 7.2.3 Marginalization If \\(P\\) is a joint-probability distribution over event space \\(\\Omega = \\Omega_1 \\times \\dots \\Omega_n\\), the marginal distribution over subspace \\(\\Omega_i\\), \\(1 \\le i \\le n\\) is the probability distribution that assigns to all \\(A_i \\subseteq \\Omega_i\\) the probability:15 \\[ P(A_i) = \\sum_{A_1 \\subseteq \\Omega_{1}, \\dots , A_{i-1} \\subseteq \\Omega_{i-1}, A_{i+1} \\subseteq \\Omega_{i+1}, \\dots, A_n \\subseteq \\Omega_n} P(A_1, \\dots, A_{i-1}, A_{i}, A_{i+1}, \\dots A_n) \\] For example, the marginal distribution over coin flips derivable from the joint probability distribution in Table 7.1 gives \\(P(\\text{heads}) = P(\\text{tails}) = 0.5\\), since the sum of each column is exactly \\(0.5\\). The marginal distribution over flips derivable from Table 7.1 has \\(P(\\text{black}) = 0.3\\) and \\(P(\\text{black}) = 0.7\\).16 With \\(\\Omega_{\\text{flip}} = \\left \\{ \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\right \\}\\) and \\(\\Omega_{\\text{draw}} = \\left \\{ \\text{black}, \\text{white} \\right \\}\\).↩ This notation, using \\(\\sum\\), assumes that subspaces are countable. In other cases, a parallel definition with integrals can be used.↩ The term ``marginal distribution’’ derives from such probability tables, where traditionally the sum of each row/column was written in the margins.↩ "],
["conditional-probability.html", "7.3 Conditional probability", " 7.3 Conditional probability Fix probability distribution \\(P \\in \\Delta(\\Omega)\\) and events \\(A,B \\subseteq \\Omega\\). The conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\), written as \\(P(A \\mid B)\\), gives the probability of \\(A\\) on the assumption that \\(B\\) is true.17 It is defined like so: \\[P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\] Conditional probabilities are only defined when \\(P(B) &gt; 0\\).18 Example. If a die is unbiased, each of its six faces has equal probability to come up after a toss. The probability of event \\(B = \\{\\) ⚀, ⚂, ⚄ \\(\\}\\) that the tossed number is odd has probability \\(P(B) = \\frac{1}{2}\\). The probability of event \\(A = \\{\\) ⚂, ⚃, ⚄, ⚅ \\(\\}\\) that the tossed number is bigger than two is \\(P(A) = \\frac{2}{3}\\). The probability that the tossed number is bigger than two odd is \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(\\{\\) ⚂, ⚄ \\(\\}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\). The conditional probability of tossing a number that is bigger than two, when we know that the toss is even, is \\(P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{1 / 3}{1 / 2} = \\frac{2}{3}\\). Algorithmically, conditional probability first rules out all events in which \\(B\\) is not true and then simply renormalizes the probabilities assigned to the remaining events in such a way that the relative probabilities of surviving events remains unchanged. Given this, another way of interpreting conditional probability is that \\(P(A \\mid B)\\) is what a rational agent believe about \\(A\\) after observing that \\(B\\) is in fact true and nothing more. The agent rules out, possibly hypothetically, that \\(B\\) is false, but otherwise does not change opinion about the relative probabilities of anything that is compatible with \\(B\\). 7.3.1 Bayes rule Looking back at the joint-probability distribution in Table 7.1, the conditional probability \\(P(\\text{black} \\mid \\text{heads})\\) of drawing a black ball, given that the initial coin flip showed heads, can be calculated as follows: \\[ P(\\text{black} \\mid \\text{heads}) = \\frac{P(\\text{black} , \\text{heads})}{P(\\text{heads})} = \\frac{0.1}{0.5} = 0.2 \\] This calculation, however, is quite spurious. We knew that already from the way the flip-&amp;-draw scenario was set up. After flipping heads, we draw from urn 1, which has \\(k=2\\) out of \\(N=10\\) black balls, so clearly: if the flip is heads, then the probability of a black ball is \\(0.2\\). Indeed, in a step-wise random generation process like the flip-&amp;-draw scenario, some conditional probabilities are very clear, and sometimes given by definition. These are, usually, the conditional probabilities that define how the process unfolds forward in time, so to speak. Bayes rule is a way of expressing, in a manner of speaking, conditional probabilities in terms of the “reversed” conditional probabilities: \\[P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A \\mid B) \\times P(B)}{P(A)}\\] Bayes rule is straightforward corollary of the definition of conditional probabilities, according to which \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B) \\times P(B)\\), so that: \\[ P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)} = \\frac{P(A \\mid B) \\cdot P(B)}{P(A)} \\] Bayes rule allows for reasoning backwards from observed causes to likely underlying effects. When we have a feed-forward model of how unobservable effects probabilistically constrain observable outcomes, Bayes rule allows us to draw inferences about latent/unobservable variables based on the observation of their downstream effects. Consider yet again the flip-&amp;-draw scenario. But now assume that Jones flipped the coin and drew a ball. We see that it is black. What is the probability that it was drawn from urn 1, equivalently, that the coin landed heads? It is not \\(P(\\text{heads}) = 0.5\\), the so-called prior probability of the coin landing heads. It is a conditional probability, also called the posterior probability,19 namely \\(P(\\text{heads} \\mid \\text{black})\\), but one that is not as easy and straightforward to write down as the reverse \\(P(\\text{black} \\mid \\text{heads})\\) of which we said above that it is an almost trivial part of the set up of the flip-&amp;-draw scenario. It is here that Bayes rule has its purpose: \\[ P(\\text{heads} \\mid \\text{black}) = \\frac{P(\\text{black} \\mid \\text{heads}) \\times P(\\text{heads})}{P(\\text{black})} = \\frac{0.2 \\times 0.5}{0.3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\] This result is quite intuitive. Drawing a black ball from urn 2 (i.e., after seeing tails) is twice as likely as drawing a black ball from urn 1 (i.e., after seeing heads). Consequently, after seeing a black ball drawn, with equal probabilities of heads and tails, the probability that the coin landed tails is also twice as large as that it landed heads. We also verbalize this as “the conditional probability of \\(A\\) conditioned on \\(B\\).”↩ Updating with events which have probability zero entails far more severe adjustments of the underlying belief system than just ruling out information hitherto considered possible. Formal systems that capture such belief revision are studied in formal epistemology Halpern (2003) .↩ The terms prior and posterior make sense when we think about an agent’s belief state before (prior to) and after (posterior to) an observation.↩ "],
["random-variables.html", "7.4 Random variables", " 7.4 Random variables We have so far define a probability distribution as a function that assigns a probability to each subset of the space \\(\\Omega\\) of elementary outcomes. A special case occurs when we are interested in a space of numeric outcomes. A random variable is a function \\(X \\ \\colon \\ \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) that assigns to each elementary outcome a numerical value. Example. For a single flip of a coin we have \\(\\Omega_{\\text{coin flip}} = \\left \\{ \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\right \\}\\). A usual way of mapping this onto numerical outcomes is to define \\(X_{\\text{coin flip}} \\ \\colon \\ \\text{heads} \\mapsto 1; \\text{tails} \\mapsto 0\\). Less trivially, consider flipping a coin two times. Elementary outcomes should be individuated by the outcome of the first flip and the outcome of the second flip, so that we get: \\[ \\Omega_{\\text{two flips}} = \\left \\{ \\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{heads} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{tails}, \\text{heads} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{tails}, \\text{tails} \\rangle \\right \\} \\] Consider the random variable \\(X_{\\text{two flips}}\\) that counts the total number of heads. Crucially, \\(X_{\\text{two flips}}(\\langle \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\rangle) = 1 = X_{\\text{two flips}}(\\langle \\text{tails}, \\text{heads} \\rangle)\\). We assign the same numerical value to different elementary outcomes. 7.4.1 Notation &amp; terminology Traditionally random variables are represented by capital letters, like \\(X\\). Variables for the numeric values they take on are written as small letters, like \\(x\\). We write \\(P(X = x)\\) as a shorthand for the probability \\(P(\\left \\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega \\mid X(\\omega) = 2 \\right \\})\\) that an event occurs that is mapped onto \\(x\\) by random variable \\(X\\). For example, if our coin is fair, then \\(P(X_{\\text{two flips}} = x) = 0.5\\) for \\(x=1\\) and \\(0.25\\) otherwise. Similarly, we can also write \\(P(X \\le x)\\) for the probability of observing an event that \\(X\\) maps to a number not bigger than \\(x\\). If the range of \\(X\\) is countable, we say that \\(X\\) is discrete. For ease of exposition, we may say that if the range of \\(X\\) is an interval of real numbers, \\(X\\) is called continuous. 7.4.2 Cumulative distribution functions, mass &amp; density For a discrete random variable \\(X\\), the cumulative distribution function \\(F_X\\) associated with \\(X\\) is defined as: \\[ F_X(x) = P(X \\le x) = \\sum_{x&#39; \\in \\left \\{ \\text{Rng}(X) \\mid x&#39; \\le x \\right \\}} P(X = x) \\] The probability mass function \\(f_x\\) associated with \\(X\\) is defined as: \\[ f_X(x) = P(X = x) \\] Example. Suppose we flip a coin with a bias of \\(\\theta\\) \\(n\\) times. What is the probability that we will see heads \\(k\\) times? If we map the outcome of heads to 1 and tails to 0, this probability is given by the , as follows: \\[ \\text{Binom}(K = k ; n, \\theta) = \\binom{n}{k} \\, \\theta^{k} \\, (1-\\theta)^{n-k} \\] Here \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\) is the binomial coefficient. It gives the number of possibilities of drawing an unordered set with \\(k\\) elements from a set with a total of \\(n\\) elements. Figure 7.1 gives an example of the Binomial distribution, concretely its probability mass function, for two values of the coin’s bias, \\(\\theta = 0.25\\) or \\(\\theta = 0.5\\), when flipping the coin \\(n=24\\) times. Figure 7.2 gives the corresponding cumulative distributions. Figure 7.1: Examples of the Binomial distribution.

The \\(y\\)-axis gives the probability of seeing \\(k\\) or less outcomes of heads when flipping a coin \\(n=24\\) times with a bias of either \\(\\theta = 0.25\\) or \\(\\theta = 0.5\\). For a continuous random variable \\(X\\), the probability \\(P(X = x)\\) will usually be zero: it is virtually impossible that we will see precisely the value \\(x\\) realized in a random event that can realize uncountably many numerical values of \\(X\\). However, \\(P(X \\le x)\\) does take workable values and so we define the \\(F_X\\) associated with \\(X\\) as: \\[ F_X(x) = P(X \\le x) \\] Instead of a probability mass function, we derive a probability density function from the cumulative function as: \\[ f_X(x) = F&#39;(x) \\] A probability density function can take values greater than one, unlike a probability mass function. Example. The Gaussian or Normal distribution characterizes many natural distributions of measurements which are symmetrically spread around a central tendency. It is defined as: \\[ \\mathcal{N}(X = x ; \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\sigma^2 \\pi}} \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right) \\] where parameter \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, the central tendency, and parameter \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.

["two-notions-of-probability-revisited.html", "8.2 Two notions of probability (revisited)", " 8.2 Two notions of probability (revisited) What are probabilities? Two viewpoints can be distinguished: Probabilities exist “outside in the world” or they are “subjective beliefs” (Kruschke 2015). Although both notions imply different approaches how to deal with probabilities, the mathematical properties are quite similar (Kruschke 2015). 8.2.1 Frequentism — Probabilities as properties of the world When thinking about probabilities as existing “outside in the world” one has to consider the random process that produces the observed data. A Frequentist imagine this random process being repeated a large number of times so that the probability of an outcome is the number of observed outcomes divided by the total number of observations \\(n\\) (Dobson and Barnett 2008). Frequentism is an approach that searches for relative frequencies in a large number of trials (Vallverdú 2016). The parameter \\(\\theta\\), the probability of interest, is the value of the relative frequency when \\(n\\) becomes infinitely large. Consequently, the parameter \\(\\theta\\) can be estimated from the observed data, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\), by maximizing the likelihood function (see section “Likelihood, Prior &amp; Posterior”) (Dobson and Barnett 2008). 8.2.2 Bayesianism — Probabilities as subjective beliefs Another notion of probabilities is to think of them as “beliefs” inside one’s mind. The core of Bayesian methods is Bayes’ theorem which describes how prior belief is combined with observed data: \\[P(H|Data)=\\frac{P(Data|H)*P(H)}{P(Data)}\\] \\[Posterior=\\frac{Likelihood*Prior}{Marginal\\textrm{ } Likelihood},\\] The job of the “marginal Likelihood” in the denominator is to standardize the posterior and thus to ensure it sums up to one (integrates to one). Therefore, the key lesson of Bayes’ theorem is (McElreath 2015): \\[Posterior \\propto Likelihood * Prior\\] A parameter in Bayesian methods is conceptualized as a random variable with its own distribution (the posterior) that summarizes the current state of knowledge. The expected value of the posterior is the best guess about the true value of the parameter and its variability reflects the amount of uncertainty (Kline 2013). In Frequentist statistics, a parameter is seen as a constant that should be estimated with sample statistics (Kline 2013). References "],

["likelihood-prior-posterior.html", "9.1 Likelihood, Prior, &amp; Posterior", " 9.1 Likelihood, Prior, &amp; Posterior Before the topic of is introduced, some conceptual notions regarding likelihood, prior and posterior are necessary. 9.1.1 Probability density function vs. Likelihood function As already introduced, for a coin flip the probability of each outcome can be modeled with the Bernoulli distribution, because two discrete outcomes (head or tail) and a constant probability \\(\\theta\\) exist: \\[p([X=x]|\\theta)=\\theta^{[x]}(1-\\theta)^{(1-[x])}\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the probability of coin-flip-outcome “head”, and the bracket [ ] indicates that the particular parameter is treated as unknown. With the formula above the probability of \\(\\theta\\) is treated as “known”. Accordingly, the distribution of possible outcomes can be derived. But often the contrary is the case, that is one is interested in the value of \\(\\theta\\) by a given data set. Then \\(\\theta\\) is unknown and the data are observed. Treating \\(\\theta\\) as parameter instead of \\(x\\) leads to the likelihood function — a mathematical formula that specifies the plausibility of the data. It states the probability of any possible observation: \\[p(X=x|[\\theta])=[\\theta]^x(1-[\\theta])^{(1-x)}\\] (#fig:ch-03-03-likelihood distribution)Bernoulli likelihood for simulated observed coin-flip data. Please be aware that through exchanging the roles of \\(x\\) and \\(\\theta\\) in the second equation (likelihood function) this function is no longer a probability distribution and thus does not integrate to 1. 9.1.2 Prior &amp; Posterior The clearest difference between frequentist and Bayesian methods is the incorporation of prior information in the Bayesian framework. The posterior distribution results by combining the likelihood with the prior information: \\[Posterior \\propto Prior \\cdot Likelihood,\\] or \\[P(B|A) \\propto P(B) \\cdot P(A|B).\\] When an uninformative (e.g. uniform) prior \\(P(B)\\) is used then the posterior \\(P(B|A)\\) is completely dependent on the data (likelihood) \\(P(A|B)\\). The influence of the prior on the posterior depends on their relative weighting. Remember, the posterior is the conditional distribution of the parameter given the data. The mathematical procedure behind it is depicted by Bayes’ Theorem. Consider for example a beta distribution with the parameters a and b: \\(\\theta \\sim Beta(a,b)\\) for expressing prior knowledge. Assume further that the observed data are derived from a coin flip experiment, thus, the likelihood function is a bernoulli likelihood. The parameters of a beta distribution can be interpreted as \\(a=\\)no. of heads and $b = $no. of tails, or in other words: \\(n=a+b\\). Consequently, Beta(1,1) has a lower weight and thus influence on the posterior than Beta(5,5). (#fig:ch-03-03-prior distributions)Uninformative vs. informative beta prior distribution. (#fig:ch-03-03-posterior distributions)Beta posterior distributions for different beta prior distributions and bernoulli likelihood. A lot of effort has been done in the area of “Objective Bayesian data analysis” in order to develop “uninformative prior distributions”, because a lot of people feel uncomfortable using informative priors — seeing them as biased or unscientific. On the contrary, most people interpret results based on their prior experiences and in this light, prior information is just a way to quantify this (Dobson and Barnett 2008). It is “just” important that the definition of the prior distributions make sense (at every stage) in the model. 9.1.2.1 Exursos: Prior predictive distribution So far we have seen that the over parameters captures the initial assumptions or state of knowledge about the psychological variables they represent (Lee and Wagenmakers 2014), in the above example this variable is \\(\\theta\\). Considering these initial assumptions in terms of prior distributions allow to make predictions about what data we would expect given the model and current state of knowledge. This distribution is called prior predictive distribution. It is a distribution over data, and gives the relative probability of different observable outcomes before any data have been seen (Lee and Wagenmakers 2014). For the coin flip model we consider a flat prior distribution: Beta(1,1). The prior predictive distribution would therefore look like: (#fig:ch-03-03-prior predictive distribution)Prior predictive distribution with Beta(1,1) prior for coin flip model References "],
["modeling.html", "9.2 Modeling", " 9.2 Modeling 9.2.1 Introductory example As introductory example we considered a coin flip experiment and asked if a particular coin is biased. In order to investigate this question a coin is flipped \\(x\\) times (= trials) and the number of success (i.e. numbers of “head”) \\(k\\) is recorded. This is repeated \\(n\\) times (=observations). ## # A tibble: 10 x 3 ## n k x ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 15 30 ## 2 2 15 30 ## 3 3 15 30 ## 4 4 16 30 ## 5 5 12 30 ## 6 6 15 30 ## 7 7 15 30 ## 8 8 14 30 ## 9 9 16 30 ## 10 10 9 30 The above table shows the observed outcome, but how the underlying probability of coming up heads can be derived from that data set? 9.2.2 Steps of Data Analysis The approach described here is based on (McElreath 2015; Kruschke 2015). Although the approach is introduced in a Bayesian context, it can be used as a general guideline (with some caveats): Identify the relevant variables according to the hypothesis (Measurement scales, predicted vs. predictor variables). Define the descriptive model for the relevant variables. likelihood distribution (distribution of each outcome variable that defines the plausibility of individual observations) parameters (define and name all parameters of the model in order to relate the likelihood to the predictor variable(s)) Bayesian context: Specify prior distribution(s). Further steps that will be subject of later chapters: Inference and interpretation of the results. Model checking (Is the defined model adequate?) In the following we are interested in the question if a certain coin is biased. First step is to identify the relevant variables. For the coin flip experiment a coin is flipped \\(n\\) times, whereby each observation consists of \\(x\\) trials. Imagine for example 10 people flip a coin 30 times, then \\(n=10\\) and \\(x=30\\). The variable coin flip \\(Y\\) is dichotomous with the possible outcomes “head” and “tail”. For each observation the outcome is recorded: “0” for coming up tail and “1” for coming up head. The data are summarized for each observation. The variable \\(k\\) indicates the number of heads coming up in \\(x\\) trials. In the second step a descriptive model for the identified variables has to be defined. An underlying probability \\(\\theta\\) is assumed, indicating the probability of heads coming up \\(p(y=1)\\). The probability that the outcome is head, given a value of parameter \\(\\theta\\), is the value of \\(\\theta\\) (Kruschke 2015, 109). Formally, this can be written as \\[p(y=1|\\theta)=\\theta\\] As only two outcomes of \\(Y\\) exists, the probability that the outcome is tail is the complementary probability \\(1-\\theta\\). Both probabilities can be combined in one probability expression: \\[Pr(Y|n,\\theta)=\\frac{n!}{y!(n-y)!}\\theta^{y}(1-\\theta)^{n-y}.\\] This probability distribution is called the Binomial distribution. The fracture at the beginning indicates how many ordered sequences of \\(n\\) outcomes a count \\(y\\) have. (#fig:ch-03-03-binomial distribution-coin flip example)Binomial distribution for different coin biases When the coin is flipped only once, then the probability can be written as: \\[Pr(Y|\\theta)=\\theta^{y}(1-\\theta)^{1-y}.\\] This special variant of the Binomial distribution is the so-called Bernoulli distribution. To see the connection to the first considerations: When the outcome “head” is observed the equation reduces to \\(Pr(y=1|\\theta)=\\theta\\) and when the outcome “tail” is observed the equation results in \\(Pr(y=0|\\theta)=(1-\\theta).\\) Accordingly, for the introductory example it can be noted that the coin flip variable \\(Y\\) is distributed as Binomial distribution. (Note: For Bayes’ rule the likelihood function is needed. Remember, the likelihood function treats \\(\\theta\\) as unknow and the data as known. This role of parameter is exchanged in a probability distribution.) (#fig:ch-03-03-binomial likelihood-coin flip example)Binomial likelihoods for different observed coin flip outcomes. The third step is solely a Bayesian idea, that is the incorporation of prior knowledge. What do we believe about the coin bias \\(\\theta\\) before seeing the data? Assuming that no expectation about \\(\\theta\\) exists a priori, indicating that all values of \\(\\theta\\) between 0 and 1 are equally probable. This can be modeled by a uniform distribution or as already visualized as Beta distribution with parameters a=1 and b=1 (see following figure). (#fig:ch-03-03-prior distribution-coin flip example)Using uninformative prior distributions: The Uniform(0,1) and Beta(1,1) prior. So far, the coin flip model is defined conceptually. In the following some notational considerations have to be made. 9.2.3 Notation 9.2.3.1 Textual notation In the textual notation, first the prior assumptions (if the Bayesian perspective is taken) are described. For the coin flip example this is: \\[\\theta \\sim Beta(1,1).\\] The symbol “\\(\\sim\\)” means “is distributed as”, thus, the above equation says before seeing the data all possible values of \\(\\theta\\) between 0 and 1 are assumed to be equally likely. Subsequently, the descriptive model for the data has to be defined. As already described in the section above, it is assumed that the observed data (upcoming of heads \\(k\\)) are distributed as Binomial distribution with given \\(n\\) (number of observations) and unknown \\(\\theta\\). This relation is denoted symbolically as \\[k\\sim Binomial(\\theta|n).\\] To summarize the current model (whereby the prior knowledge is only considered from a Bayesian perspective): \\[\\theta \\sim Beta(1,1),\\] \\[k\\sim Binomial(\\theta|n).\\] 9.2.3.2 Graphical notation When models get very complex and incorporate many parameters it can be difficult to tease out all relations between the model components. In such a situation a graphical notation of a model might be helpful. In the following the convention described in Wagenmakers and Lee’s Bayesian Cognitive Modelling (2014) is used: The graph structure is used to indicate dependencies between the variables, with children depending on their parents (Lee and Wagenmakers 2014). General conventions: Nodes - problem relevant variables, shaded nodes - observed variables, unshaded nodes - unobserved variables, circular nodes - continuous variables, square nodes - discrete variables, single line - stochastic dependency, and double line - deterministic dependency. For the introductory example this indicates: relevant variables: number of trials (\\(n\\)), number of success (\\(k\\)) and probability for a success (\\(\\theta\\)), observed variables: \\(n\\) and \\(k\\), unobserved variables: \\(\\theta\\), continuous variable: \\(\\theta\\), discrete variables: \\(n\\) and \\(k\\). In the next step the dependencies have to be determined: The number of success \\(k\\) depends on the probability of a success \\(\\theta\\) as well as on the number of trials \\(n\\). Finally, the graphical structure together with the textual notation can be represented: Graphical notation Beta-Binomial Model - One group 9.2.4 An outlook: Hierarchical models Often data can be considered as part of an overall structure. Single observations can be modelled belonging into different groups. These groups in turn are part of a superordinate group etc. Such information are presented in a model in form of a hierarchy. For example, consider again the coin flip experiment. The outcome of head is influenced by the probability \\(\\theta\\). Further, \\(\\theta\\) is assumed to be distributed as Beta(1,1). Remember that the parameter a and b of a Beta-distribution can be considered in this context as: \\(a=\\)number of heads and \\(b=\\) number of tails, consequently, \\(n=a+b\\). 9.2.4.1 Reparameterization of a Beta distribution Probability distributions can be described by their central tendency and spread (or dispersion). The mode of a Beta distribution is defined as: \\(\\omega=\\frac{a-1}{a+b-2}\\), and the concentration as: \\(\\kappa=a+b.\\) The nice thing is, that the definition of the mode as well as of the concentration consists solely of the parameters a and b. Therefore, it is possible to re-express the parameters of a Beta density in terms of \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\kappa\\), such that: \\[Beta(a,b)=Beta\\left(\\omega(\\kappa -2)+1, (1-\\omega)(\\kappa -2)+1\\right).\\] Why this is useful? And what is its value in connection with hierarchical modeling? Return back to the coin flip experiment. So far, the parameters of the prior on \\(\\theta\\) are fixed: \\(a=1\\) and \\(b=1\\). Assume that we get further information: The manufacturing process of the coins has a bias near \\(\\omega\\) (example taken from (Kruschke 2015)). But how to incorporate this additional knowledge in the model? At this point, the hierarchy and the reparameterization come into play. Hierarchy because a further assumption is placed on top of the existing model and reparameterization, because we want to express the prior in terms of the mode \\(\\omega\\). Such that the model can be assumed as follows: Graphical notation hierarchical Beta-Binomial Model - One group Now, the parameters of the hyperpriors (Gamma and Beta) are fixed, but they can be treated as parameters as well … as such hierarchical models can be created with any degree of complexity: Graphical notation hierarchical Beta-Binomial Model - One group References "],

Consider now, that a second coin \\(y_2\\) is introduced. One question that arises might be for example: How different are the biases of the two coins? #simulate flips of two coins sample.space &lt;- c(0,1) ##First coin: theta1 &lt;- 0.5 # probability of a success (here: head) X1 &lt;- 30 # number of trials in the experiment n1 &lt;- 100 # number of observations k1 &lt;- 0 # number of heads [initialization] for (i in 1: n1) { k1[i] &lt;- sum(sample(sample.space, size = X1, replace = TRUE, prob = c(theta1, 1 - theta1))) } ##Second coin: theta2 &lt;- 0.7 # probability of a success (here: head) X2 &lt;- 30 # number of trials in the experiment n2 &lt;- 100 # number of observations k2 &lt;- 0 # number of heads [initialization] ## repeat experiment N-times for (i in 1: n2) { k2[i] &lt;- sum(sample(sample.space, size = X2, replace = TRUE, prob = c(theta2, 1 - theta2))) } ## show results in a tibble coin.flip2 &lt;- tibble(&quot;coin&quot; = c(replicate(n1,&quot;coin1&quot;), replicate(n2,&quot;coin2&quot;)), &quot;n&quot; = c(seq(from=1, to=n1, by=1), seq(from=1, to=n2, by=1)), &quot;k&quot; = c(k1,k2), &quot;x&quot; = c(replicate(n1,X1), replicate(n2,X2)) ) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 200 x 4 ## coin n k x ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 coin1 1 17 30 ## 2 coin1 2 14 30 ## 3 coin1 3 16 30 ## 4 coin1 4 13 30 ## 5 coin1 5 16 30 ## 6 coin1 6 15 30 ## 7 coin1 7 15 30 ## 8 coin1 8 11 30 ## 9 coin1 9 16 30 ## 10 coin1 10 12 30 ## # … with 190 more rows #Plotting the observed results ggplot(data=coin.flip2,mapping = aes(x=k, fill=coin ))+ geom_histogram() 9.3.1.1 Conceptual steps for modeling We suppose that the underlying probabilities of the two coins correspond to different latent variables \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\). First step is again the identification of the relevant variables according to the research question. As already indicated for the “one coin” example we have: the observed number of heads \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\) (for each coin, respectively), which is influenced by the number of observations \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) and by the underlying probabilities \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\). Furthermore, from a conceptional perspective, we are interested in the difference between the coin biases. Therefore a further variable will be introduced \\(\\delta\\), defined by: \\[\\delta =\\theta_1 - \\theta_2.\\] The distributional assumptions, according to the second and third step, can be adopted from the “one coin” example, such that the graphical notation (including the textual notation) can be denoted as follows: 9.3.1.2 Notation Beta-Binomial Model - Two Groups Graphical notation Beta-Binomial Model - Two groups 9.3.2 Simple linear regression with one metric predictor The following example originates from a data set in which speed of cars and the distance taken to stop was recorded. It is a simple data set good for introducing the basic ideas for simple linear regression. #The &quot;cars&quot; data set data(cars) #take a look at the variables included in the data set str(cars) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 50 obs. of 2 variables: ## $ speed: num 4 4 7 7 8 9 10 10 10 11 ... ## $ dist : num 2 10 4 22 16 10 18 26 34 17 ... One possible question could be how much the stopping distance increases when the speed of a car increases. 9.3.2.1 Conceptual steps for modeling First step is to identify the relevant variables. In this case these are “speed” measured in mph and “distance” measured in ft, thus, both variables are metric variables. As distance will be predicted from speed. The predicted variable is “distance” and the predictor variable is “speed”. A scatter plot can visualize a possible relationship between both variables. plot(x=cars$speed,y=cars$dist, type=&quot;p&quot;, main=&quot;scatter plot of cars data set&quot;, ylab=&quot;distance in ft&quot;, xlab=&quot;speed in mph&quot;) Next step is to define a descriptive model of the data. According to the scatter plot it is not too absurd to think that distance might be proportional to speed. Therefore, a linear relationship between both variables can be assumed, where speed is used i order to predict distance. But how can the distribution of the predicted variable “distance” be described? The following plot shows in blue the density of the actual distance values. #density of distance values in blue #(in black simulation of a normal distribution) dens(cars$dist, col=&quot;blue&quot;, norm.comp = TRUE, main=&quot;Distribution of distance&quot;, xlab=&quot;distance in ft&quot;) Although the distribution of “distance” values is not identical to the corresponding normal distribution, it can be assumed that the values follow a normal distribution. The underlying consideration is that the distance values \\(y_i\\) are distributed randomly according to a normal distribution around the predicted value \\(\\hat{y}\\) and with a standard deviation denoted with \\(\\sigma\\). This can be denoted as: \\[y_i\\sim Normal(\\mu, \\sigma).\\] The index \\(i\\) indicates each element (i.e. car) of the list \\(y\\), which in turn is the list of distances. In the third step, a Bayesian perspective is taken the prior knowlege (before seeing the data) has to be defined. The parameters of the current model are the predicted value \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). For the parameter \\(\\mu\\) a normal distribution can be assumend with parameters that reflect the estimated values from the sample. #descriptive statistics from the sample tibble(variables=c(&quot;speed&quot;, &quot;distance&quot;), mean=c(mean(cars$speed),mean(cars$dist)), sigma = c(sd(cars$speed), sd(cars$dist))) ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## variables mean sigma ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 speed 15.4 5.29 ## 2 distance 43.0 25.8 \\[\\mu\\sim Normal(43,26)\\] For the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) a uniform distribution is assumed: \\[\\sigma\\sim Uniform(0,40)\\] 9.3.2.2 Excursus: Identically and independently distributed (iid) The short model description \\(y_i\\sim Normal(\\mu, \\sigma)\\) incorporates often already an assumption about the distribution of distance-values: They are identically and independently distributed. Often the abbreviation iid can be found for this assumption: \\[y_i\\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim} Normal(\\mu, \\sigma).\\] The abbreviation iid indicates that each value \\(y_i\\) has the same probability function, independent of the other \\(y\\) values and using the same parameters (McElreath 2015). This is hardly ever true (why hierarchical modeling is very attractive). For example, thinking about the cars in the current example data set. Some cars may be of different types or even the same type but different batches. But the question is: Is this underlying dependency relevant for the model? If yes, this information has to be added in the model (e.g. in form of a hierarchical model). Janyes states it as follows: “The onus is always on the user to make sure that all information, which his common sense tells him is relevant to the problem, is actually incorporated into the equations, (…).”(Jaynes 2003, 339). But if one do not know any relevant underlying relationships the most conservative distribution to use is iid. Note, that the stated assumptions define how the model represents a problem and not how the world should be understood. For example, there might exist underlying correlations but on the overall distribution there influence tends towards zero. In such cases it remains usefull to assume iid (McElreath 2015). 9.3.3 Notation Simple Regression model Graphical notation Simplre Regression model References "],
["further-elaboration-on-modeling-in-anticipation-of-the-topic-estimation.html", "9.4 Further elaboration on modeling (in anticipation of the topic “estimation”)", " 9.4 Further elaboration on modeling (in anticipation of the topic “estimation”) 9.4.1 Beta-Binomial model - one group (revisited) Sofar the existence of the underlying probability \\(\\theta\\) for observing head as outcome of a coin flip has been discussed. But the estimation of \\(\\theta\\) has been ignored until yet. Although “estimation” will be topic of next chapter, it is helpful at this point to discuss the introduced models further. In order to estimate \\(\\theta\\) parameter(s) are needed. When it comes to estimation exactly this/these parameter(s) will be the result(s), therefore is is important to see already the connection to the models that were developed in this chapter. For the coin flip example the value of interest is the underlying probability, thus, only one parameter is needed:\\(\\beta_0\\). (Note: Latin letters are used when we refer to the sample, Greek letters are used when we refer to the population.) How is \\(\\beta_0\\) linked to the latent variable \\(\\theta\\)? Considering for example the simplest case: a linear relationship (see next plot left side). The problem which arises at this point is that \\(\\theta\\) represents a probability, and is therefore bounded to the range 0-1 (grey shaded area). #Different relationships between the parameter and expected value x &lt;- seq(from=-4, to=4, length.out = 100) y &lt;- x #linear relationship y.log &lt;- inv_logit_scaled(x) #logistic relationship par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) #set both plot beside each other plot(x, y, type=&quot;l&quot;, ylab=expression(theta), xlab=expression(beta[0])) rect(-5, 0, 5, 1, col = rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1/4), border = NA) plot(x, y.log, type=&quot;l&quot;, ylab=expression(logit~(theta)), xlab=expression(beta[0])) rect(-5, 0, 5, 1, col = rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1/4), border = NA) A mathematical transformation is needed such that the parameter \\(\\beta_0\\) can take any value while \\(\\theta\\) is bounded to the range 0-1. One transformation that offers exactly this possibility is the logit link function (see above plot right side) \\[logit(\\theta) = \\beta_0.\\] As the underlying assumption maps the parameter to the latent variable \\(\\theta\\) (and not the other way around) from a conceptional point of view the inverse link function is more appropriate, which is the logistic link in this case: \\[\\theta = logistic(\\beta_0).\\] It is defined as \\[\\theta=\\frac{exp(\\beta_0)}{1+exp(\\beta_0)}.\\] Both expression, logit and logistic link achieve mathematically the same result but it is conceptually just a different matter of emphasis (Kruschke 2015). 9.4.1.1 Notation of beta-binomial model - one group (revisited) The current descriptive model incorporates the idea that parameter \\(\\beta_0\\) is estimated from the given sample. It defines the latent variable \\(\\theta\\). The parameter is mapped to \\(\\theta\\) by a logistic link function. The underlying probability \\(\\theta\\) designates the observed number of upcoming heads. The number of upcoming heads in turn, is assumed to be distributed as Binomial distribution. 9.4.2 Beta-Binomial model - two groups (revisited) In the above model for two coins the latent variable \\(\\delta\\) was already introduced. It is defined by the difference between the underlying probabilities \\(\\theta_1-\\theta_2\\). Which parameters should be used in order to estimate the difference between both groups? As we will see, it turns out that the same mathematical form can be used, as one would use for simple linear regression: \\[\\theta_j=\\beta_0+\\beta_1*X_{Group_j},\\] \\[\\textrm{with } X_{Group_j}=\\begin{cases} 0, \\textrm{if coin 2,}\\\\ 1, \\textrm{if coin 1.} \\end{cases}\\] Considering coin 2, the above equation would result in \\[\\theta_2 = \\beta_0,\\] which is the intercept and indicates the proportion of head coming up for coin 2. Considering by contrast coin 1, then the equation would result in: \\[\\theta_1 = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1.\\] The proportion of coming up head for coin 1 has to be calculated by summing up the intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) and the slope \\(\\beta_1\\). Taken together: What is the interpretation of the slope \\(\\beta_1\\)? The difference \\(\\delta=\\theta_1-\\theta2\\) is \\[\\theta_1 - \\theta_2 = (\\beta_0+\\beta_1)-\\beta_0=\\beta_1=\\delta,\\] the slope \\(\\beta_1\\), thus, we can see that this parameterization enables us to estimate the difference between two groups. When in comes to estimation and interpretation the results will be the intercept \\(b_0\\) and the slope \\(b_1\\). 9.4.3 Simple linear regression model (revisited) References "],

Furthermore the sampling distributions of many estimators depend on the normal distribution. On the one hand because they are derived from normally distributed random variables or on the other hand because they can be asymptotically approximated by a normal distribution for large samples (Central limit theorem). Distributions of the normal family are symmetric with range \\((-\\infty,+\\infty)\\) and have two parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) that are referred to, respectively, as the mean and the standard deviation of the normal random variable. These parameters are examples of location and scale parameters. The normal distribution is located at \\(\\mu\\) and its width is scaled by choice of \\(\\sigma\\). The distribution is symmetric with most observations lying aroung the central peak \\(\\mu\\) and more extreme values are further away depending on \\(\\sigma\\). \\[X\\sim Normal(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\] Fig.~ shows the probability density function of three normal distributed random variables with different parameters.

A special case of normal distributed random variables is the standard normal distributed variable with \\(\\mu=0\\) and \\(\\sigma=1\\): \\(Y\\sim Normal(0,1)\\). Each normal distribution can be converted into a standard normal distribution by z-standardization (see equation below). The advantage of standardization is that values from different scales can be compared, because they become scale independent by z-transformation.

B.1.4 Student t-distribution The t or student-t distribution was discovered by William S. Gosset in 1908 (Vallverdú 2016), who published his work under the pseudonym “student”. He worked at the Guinness factory and had to deal with the problem of small sample sizes. This challenge resulted finally in the t distribution. Accordingly, this distribution is used in particular when the sample size is small and the variance unknown, which is often the case in reality. Its shape ressembles the normal bell shape and has a peak at zero, but the t distribution is a bit lower and wider (bigger tails) than the normal distribution. The t distribution consists of a standard normal distributed random variable \\(X\\sim Normal(0,1)\\) and a \\(\\chi^2\\)-distributed random variable \\(Y\\sim \\chi^2(n)\\) (X and Y are independent): \\[T = \\frac{X}{\\sqrt{\\frac{Y}{n}}}.\\] The t distribution has range \\((-\\infty,+\\infty)\\) and one parameter \\(n\\), the degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom can be calculated by the sample size \\(n\\) minus one: \\[X \\sim t(n).\\] Fig.~ shows the probability density function of three t distributed random variables with different parameters. Notice that for small degrees of freedom \\(n\\), the t-distribution has bigger tails. This is because the t distribution was specially designed to provide more conservative test results when analyzing small samples. When the degrees of freedom increases, the t distribution approaches a normal distribution. For \\(n \\geq 30\\) this approximation is quite good. Fig.~ shows the corresponding cumulative function of the three t density distributions. rv_student &lt;- tibble( x = seq(from = -6, to = 6, by = .01), y1 = dt(x, df = 1), y2 = dt(x, df = 2), y3 = dt(x, df = 10) ) %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(&quot;y&quot;), names_to = &quot;parameter&quot;, values_to = &quot;y&quot;) %&gt;% mutate( parameter = case_when(parameter == &quot;y1&quot; ~ &quot;(1)&quot;, parameter == &quot;y2&quot; ~ &quot;(2)&quot;, parameter == &quot;y3&quot; ~ &quot;(10)&quot;) ) # dist plot ggplot(rv_student, aes(x, y, color = parameter)) + geom_line(size = 2) + labs(color = &quot;X ~ t&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) Figure B.11: Examples of probability density function of t distributions. rv_student %&gt;% group_by(parameter) %&gt;% mutate( cum_y = cumsum(y)/sum(y) ) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x, cum_y, color = parameter)) + geom_line(size = 2) + labs(color = &quot;X ~ t&quot;, y = &quot;y&quot;) Figure B.12: Examples of the cumulative distribution function of t distributions corresponding to the previous probability density functions.

B.1.5 Beta distribution The beta distribution creates a continuous distribution of numbers between 0 and 1, therefore this distribution is useful if the uncertain quantity is bounded by 0 and 1 (or 100%), is continuous, and has a single mode. In Bayesian Data Analysis the beta distribution has a special standing as prior distribution for a bernoulli or binomial (see discrete distributions) likelihood. The reason for this is that a combination of a beta prior and a bernoulli (or binomial) liklihood results in a posterior distribution with the same form as the beta distribution. Such priors are referred to as conjugate priors. A beta distribution has two parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \\[X \\sim Beta(a,b).\\] The two parameters can be interpreted as the number of observations made, such that: \\(n=a+b\\). If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) get bigger, the beta distribution gets narrower. If only \\(a\\) gets bigger the distribution moves rightward and if only \\(b\\) gets bigger the distribution moves leftward. Thus, the parameters define the shape of the distribution, therefore they are also called shape parameters. A Beta(1,1) is equivalent to a uniform distribution. Fig.~ shows the probability density function of four beta distributed random variables with different parameter values. Fig.~ shows the corresponding cumulative functions. rv_beta &lt;- tibble( x = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .01), y1 = dbeta(x, shape1 = 1, shape2 = 1), y2 = dbeta(x, shape1 = 4, shape2 = 4), y3 = dbeta(x, shape1 = 4, shape2 = 2), y4 = dbeta(x, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 4) ) %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(&quot;y&quot;), names_to = &quot;parameter&quot;, values_to = &quot;y&quot;) %&gt;% mutate( parameter = case_when(parameter == &quot;y1&quot; ~ &quot;(1,1)&quot;, parameter == &quot;y2&quot; ~ &quot;(4,4)&quot;, parameter == &quot;y3&quot; ~ &quot;(4,2)&quot;, parameter == &quot;y4&quot; ~ &quot;(2,4)&quot;) ) # dist plot ggplot(rv_beta, aes(x, y, color = parameter)) + geom_line(size = 2) + labs(color = &quot;X ~ Beta&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) Figure B.14: Examples of probability density function of beta distributions. rv_beta %&gt;% group_by(parameter) %&gt;% mutate( cum_y = cumsum(y)/sum(y) ) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x, cum_y, color = parameter)) + geom_line(size = 2) + labs(color = &quot;X ~ Beta&quot;, y = &quot;y&quot;) Figure B.15: Examples of the cumulative distribution function of beta distributions corresponding to the previous probability density functions.

Sometimes the distribution is also called rectangular distribution, due to its shape of a rectangle. The uniform distribution is in particular common for random number generation. In Bayesian Data Analysis it is often used as prior distribution to express ignorance. This can be thought in the following way: When different events are possible but no (reliable) information exists about their probability of occurence, the most conservative (and also intuitive) choice would be to assign probability such that all events are equally likely to occur. The uniform distribution model this intuition, it generates a completely random number in some interval \\([a,b)\\). The distribution is specified by two parameters: the end points \\(a\\) (minimum) and \\(b\\) (maximum): \\[X \\sim Unif(a,b).\\] When \\(a=0\\) and \\(b=1\\) the distribution is referred to as standard uniform distribution.

["selected-discrete-distributions-of-random-variables.html", "B.2 Selected discrete distributions of random variables", " B.2 Selected discrete distributions of random variables B.2.1 Binomial distribution The binomial distribution is a useful model for binary decisions where the outcome is a choice between two alternatives (e.g. Yes/No, Left/Right, Present/Absent, Head/Tail, …). The two outcomes are coded as \\(0\\) (failure) and \\(1\\) (success). Consequently, let the probability of occurence of the outcome “success” be \\(p\\), then the probability of occurence of “failure” is \\(1-p\\). Consider a coin-flip experiment, with the outcomes “head” and “tail”. If we flip a coin repeatedly, e.g. \\(30\\) times, the successive trials are independent of each other and the probability \\(p\\) is constant, then the resulting binomial distribution is a discrete random variable with outcomes \\(\\{0,1,2,...,30\\}\\). The binomial distribution has two parameters “size” and “prob”, often denoted as \\(n\\) and \\(p\\), respectively. The “size” refers to the number of trials and “prob” to the probability of success: \\[X \\sim Binomial(n,p).\\] Fig.~ shows the probability mass function of three binomial distributed random variables with different parameter values. As stated above, \\(p\\) refers to the probability of success. The higher this probability the more often we will observe the outcome coded with “1”. Therefore the distribution tends toward the right side and vice-versa. The distribution gets more symmetrical if the parameter \\(p\\) approximates 0.5.

Apart from that the same information holds as for the binomial distribution.

Remember, a binomial distribution is useful to model a binary choice with outcomes “0” and “1”. The binomial distribution has two parameters \\(p\\), the probability of success (“1”), and \\(n\\), the number of trials. Furthermore we assume that the successive trials are independent and \\(p\\) is constant. In a beta-binomial distribution \\(p\\) is not anymore assumed to be constant (or fixed) but changes from trial to trial. Thus, a further assumption about the distribution of \\(p\\) is made and here the beta distribution comes into play: the probability \\(p\\) is assumed to be randomly drawn from a beta distribution with parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the beta-binomial distribution has three parameters \\(n\\), \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \\[X \\sim BetaBinom(n,a,b).\\] For large values of a and b the distribution approaches a binomial distribution. When \\(a=1\\) and \\(b=1\\) the distribution equals a discrete uniform distribution from 0 to \\(n\\). When \\(n = 1\\), the distribution equals a bernoulli distribution. Fig.~ shows the probability mass function of three beta-binomial distributed random variables with different parameter values.

It gives the probability of a given number of events happening in a fixed interval of time. The poisson distribution is a limiting case of the binomial distribution when the number of trials becomes very large and the probability of success is small. For example the number of car accidents in Osnabrueck in the next month, the number of typing errors on a page, the number of interruptions generated by a CPU during T seconds, etc. Events described by a poisson distribution must fullfill the following conditions: they occur in non-overlapping intervals, they can not occur simultaneously and each event occurs at a constant rate. The poisson distribution has one parameter, the rate \\(\\lambda\\), sometimes also referred to as intensity: \\[X \\sim Po(\\lambda).\\] The parameter \\(\\lambda\\) can be thought of as the expected number of events in the time interval. Consequently, changing the rate parameter changes the probability of seeing different numbers of events in one interval. See Fig.~ for the probability mass function of three poisson distributed random variables with different parameter values. Notice, that the higher \\(\\lambda\\) the more symmetrical gets the distribution. In fact, the poisson distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution for a rate paramter \\(\\geq\\) 10.

["an-important-family-the-exponential-family.html", "C.1 An important family: The Exponential Family", " C.1 An important family: The Exponential Family Most common distributions used in statistical modeling are members of the exponential family. Among others: Poisson distribution, Bernoulli distribution, Normal distribution, Chi-Square distribution, and of course the Exponential distribution. In the upcoming section some of these distributions will be described in more detail. But what makes the exponential family so special? On the one hand, distributions of this family have some convenient mathematical properties which makes them attractive to use in statistical modeling. In particular for Bayesian Analysis: For example do all these distributions have a conjugate prior and the posterior distribution has a simple form. Furthermore the above example distributions are really just examples. The exponential family encompasses a wide class of distributions which makes it possible to model various cases. On the other hand, the use of distributions from the exponential family is also from a conceptional perspective attractive. Consider for example the following situation: Consider we want to infer a propability distribution subject to certain constraints. For example a coin flip experiment can have only a dichotomous outcome {0,1} and has a constant probability. Which distribution should be used in order to model this scenario? There are several possible distributions that can be used, according to which criteria should a distribution be selected? Often one attempts a conservative choice, that is to bring as little subjective information into a model as possible. Or in other terms, one goal could be to select the distribution, among all possible distributions, that is maximal ignorant and least biased given the constraints. Consequently, the question arises how “ignorance” can be measured and distributions compared according to their “information content”? This will be topic of the upcoming exursos, the key words here are “entropy”, which comes from information theory, and “Maximum Entropy Principal”. To briefly anticipate the connection between exponential family and maximum ignorance distributions: The maximum entropy principal starts with constraints that are imposed on a distribution and derives by maximizing entropy a probability density/mass function. Distributions belonging to the exponential family arise as solutions to the maximum entropy problem subject to linear constraints. In the upcoming section selected continous and discrete distributions will be described in more detail. Followed by a part which motivation is to strengthen the intuition about understanding distributions as random variables. "],
["excursos-information-entropy-and-maximum-entropy-principal.html", "C.2 Excursos: “Information Entropy” and “Maximum Entropy Principal”", " C.2 Excursos: “Information Entropy” and “Maximum Entropy Principal” C.2.1 Information Entropy Entropy is a measure of information content of an outcome of \\(X\\) such that less probable outcomes convey more information than more probable ones. Thus, entropy can be stated as a measure of uncertainty. When the goal is to find a distrbution that is as ignorant as possible, then, consequently, entropy should be maximal. Formally, entropy is defined as follows: If \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable with distribution \\(P(X=x_i)=p_i\\) then the entropy of \\(X\\) is \\[H(X)=-\\sum_{i} p_i \\log p_i.\\] If \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable with probability density \\(p(x)\\) then the differential entropy of \\(X\\) is \\[H(X)=-\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} p(x) \\log p(x) dx.\\] From which considerations is this entropy definition derived? There exist various approaches that finally come to the same answer: the above stated definition of entropy. However, the most cited derivation is Shannon’s theorem. Another and perhapse more intuitive derivation is Wallis derivation. Jaynes (2003) describes both approaches in detail. The following provides a short insight in both derivations and is taken from (Jaynes 2003). C.2.1.1 Shannon’s theorem Shannon’s approach starts by stating conditions that a measure of the \\(H_n\\) has to satisfy. It is possible to set up some kind of association between and real numbers \\(H_n\\) is a continous function of \\(p_i\\). Otherwise, an arbitrarily small change in the probability distribution would lead to a big change in the amount of uncertainty. \\(H_n\\) should correspond to common sense in that, when there are many possibilities, we are more uncertain than when there are few. This condition takes the form that in case the \\(p_i\\) are all equal, the quantity \\(h(n)\\) is a monotonic increasing function of \\(n\\). \\(H_n\\) is consistent in that, when there is more than one way of working out its value, we must get the same answer for few possible way. Under these assumptions the resulting unique measure of uncertainty of a probability distribution \\(p\\) turns out to be just the average log-probability: \\[H(p)=-\\sum_i p_i \\log(p_i).\\] (The interested reader can find a systematic derivation in (Jaynes 2003).) Accepting this interpretation of entropy, it follows that the distribution \\((p_1,...,p_n)\\) which maximizes the above equation, subject to constraints imposed by the available information, will represent the most description of what the model about the propositions \\((A_1,...,A_n)\\) (Jaynes 2003). The function \\(H\\) is called the , or the of the distribution \\(\\{p_i\\}\\). C.2.1.2 The Wallis derivation A second and perhaps more intuitive approach of deriving entropy was suggested by G. Wallis. The following description is taken from Jaynes (2003). We are given information \\(I\\), which is to be used in assigning probabilities \\(\\{p_1,...,p_m\\}\\) to \\(m\\) different probabilities. We have a total amount of probability \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i =1\\] to allocate among them. The problem can be stated as follows. Choose some integer \\(n&gt;&gt;m\\), and imagine that we have \\(n\\) little of probabilities, each of magnitude \\(\\delta=\\frac{1}{n}\\), to distribute in an way we see fit. Suppose we were to scatter these quanta at random among the \\(m\\) choices (penny-pitch game into \\(m\\) equal boxes). If we simply toss these quanta of probability at random, so that each box has an equal probability of getting them, nobody can claim that any box is being unfairly favoured over any other. If we do this and the first box receives exactly \\(n_1\\) quanta, the second \\(n_2\\) quanta etc. we will say the random experiment has generated the probability assignment: \\[p_i=n_i\\delta=\\frac{n_i}{n}, \\textrm{ with } i=1,2,...,m.\\] The probability that this will happen is the multinomial distribution: \\[m^{-n} \\frac{n!}{n_1!\\cdot...\\cdot n_m!}.\\] Now imagine that we repeatedly scatter the \\(n\\) quanta at random among the \\(m\\) boxes. Each time we do this we examine the resulting probability assignment. If it happens to conform to the information \\(I\\), we accept it; otherwise we reject it and try again. We continue until some probability assignment \\(\\{p_1,...,p_m\\}\\) is accepted. What is the most likely probability distribution to result from this game? It is the one which maximizes \\[W=\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\cdot ... \\cdot n_m!}\\] subject whatever constraints are imposed by the information \\(I\\). We can refine this procedure by using smaller quanta, i.e. large \\(n\\). By using \\[n!\\sim \\sqrt{(2\\pi n)} \\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n,\\] and taking the logarithm from it: \\[\\log(n!) \\sim \\sqrt{(2\\pi n)}+n\\log\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right),\\] we have \\[\\log(n!) \\sim \\sqrt{(2\\pi n)}+n\\log(n) - n.\\] Taking furthermore, also the logarithm from \\(W\\) and substituting \\(\\log(n!)\\) by Sterlings approximation, finally gives the definition of information entropy, as derived by Shannon’s theorem: \\[\\frac{1}{n} \\log(W) \\rightarrow -\\sum_{i=1}^{m}p_i\\log(p_i)=H(p_1,...,p_m).\\] To sum it up: Entropy is a measure of uncertainty. The higher the entropy of a random variable \\(X\\) the more uncertainty it incorporates. When the goal is to find a maximal ignorance distribution, this goal can be consequently translated into a maximization problem: Find the distribution with maximal entropy subject to existing constraints. This will be topic of the next part of our excursos. C.2.2 Deriving Probability Distributions using the Maximum Entropy Principle The maximum entropy principle is a means of deriving probability distributions given certain constraints and the assumption of maximizing entropy. One technique for solving this maximization problem is the . C.2.2.1 Lagrangian multiplier technique Given a mutivariable function \\(f(x,y,...)\\) and constraints of the form \\(g(x,y,...)=c\\), where \\(g\\) is another multivariable function with the same input space as \\(f\\) and \\(c\\) is a constant. In order to minimize (or maximize) the function \\(f\\) consider the following steps, assuming \\(f\\) to be \\(f(x)\\): Introduce a new variable \\(\\lambda\\), called , and define a new function \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) with the form: \\[\\mathcal{L}(x,\\lambda)=f(x)+\\lambda (g(x)-c).\\] Set the derivative of the function \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) equal to the zero: \\[\\mathcal{L&#39;}(x,\\lambda)=0,\\] in order to find the critical points of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\). Consider each resulting solution within the limits of the made constraints and derive the resulting distribution \\(f\\), which gives the minimum (or maximum) one is searching for. For more details see (Academy 2019) C.2.2.2 Example 1: Derivation of maximum entropy pdf with no other constraints For more details see (Finlayson 2017, @keng2017) Suppose a random variable for which we have absolutely no information on its probability distribution, beside the fact that it should be a pdf and thus, integrate to 1. We ask for the following: (Reza 1994) We assume that the maximum ignorance distribution is the one with maximum entropy. It minimizes the prior information in a distribution and is therefore the most conservative choice. For the continuous case entropy, the measure of uncertainty, is defined as \\[H(x)=-\\int_{a}^{b}p(x) \\log(p(x))dx,\\] with subject to the mentioned constraint that the sum of all probabilities is one (as it is a pdf): \\[\\int_{a}^{b}p(x)dx =1.\\] Rewrite this into the form of equation gives \\[\\mathcal{L}=-\\int_{a}^{b}p(x) \\log(p(x))dx + \\lambda \\left(\\int_{a}^{b}p(x)dx-1 \\right).\\] The next step is to the Lagrangian function. To solve this, we have to use the (Keng 2017). First differentiating \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) with respect to \\(p(x)\\) \\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p(x)}=0,\\] \\[-1-\\log(p(x))+\\lambda=0,\\] \\[p(x)=e^{(\\lambda-1)}.\\] Second, the result of \\(p(x)\\) has to satisfy the stated constraint \\[\\int_{a}^{b} p(x)dx=1,\\] \\[\\int_{a}^{b} e^{1-\\lambda} dx=1.\\] Solving this equation with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) gives: \\[\\lambda=1-\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{b-a}\\right).\\] Taking both solutions together we get the following probability density function: \\[p(x)=e^{(1-\\lambda)}=e^{\\left(1-\\left(1-\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{b-a}\\right)\\right)\\right)},\\] \\[p(x)= \\frac{1}{b-a}.\\] And this is the on the interval \\([a,b]\\). Such that, the answer of the above question is: This should not be too unexpected. As it is quite intuitive that a uniform distribution is the maximal ignorance distribution (when no other constraints were made). The next example will be more exciting. C.2.2.3 Example 2: Derivation of maximum entropy pdf with given mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) Suppose a random variable \\(X\\) with a preassigned standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) and mean \\(\\mu\\). Again the question is: The Maximum Entropy is defined for the current case as \\[H(X)=-\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x) \\log p(x)dx,\\] is subject to the constraint that it should be a pdf \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x)dx = 1,\\] and that \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are given (whereby only one constrained is needed, as the \\(\\mu\\) is already included in the definition of \\(\\sigma\\)): \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}(x-\\mu)^2 p(x) dx = \\sigma^2.\\] Accordingly to the above mentioned technique the formulas are summarized in form of the equation: \\[\\mathcal{L}= -\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x) \\log p(x)dx + \\lambda_0\\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x)dx - 1 \\right) + \\lambda_1\\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}(x-\\mu)^2 p(x) dx - \\sigma^2 \\right).\\] Next, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) will be partially differentiated with respect to \\(p(x)\\): \\[\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p(x)}=0,\\] \\[-(1+\\log p(x))+\\lambda_0+\\lambda_1 (x-\\mu)^2=0,\\] \\[p(x)=e^{\\lambda_0+\\lambda_1 (x-\\mu)^2-1}.\\] Further we have to make sure that the result holds for the stated constraints: \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\lambda_0+\\lambda_1 (x-\\mu)^2-1}-1 dx = 1,\\] and \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}(x-\\mu)^2 e^{\\lambda_0+\\lambda_1 (x-\\mu)^2-1} dx = \\sigma^2.\\] For the first constraint we get \\[e^{\\lambda_0-1} \\sqrt{-\\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda_1}} = 1,\\] and for the second constraint \\[e^{\\lambda_0-1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi}} \\frac{1}{\\sigma},\\] Thus \\[\\lambda_1=\\frac{-1}{2\\sigma^2}\\] Taking all together we can write: \\[p(x)=e^{\\lambda_0+\\lambda_1 (x-\\mu)^2-1}=e^{\\lambda_0-1}e^{\\lambda_1 (x-\\mu)^2},\\] substituting the solutions for \\(e^{\\lambda_0-1}\\) and \\(\\lambda_1\\): \\[p(x)= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi}} \\frac{1}{\\sigma} e^{\\frac{-1}{2\\sigma^2}(x-\\mu)^2},\\] finally we can rearrange the terms a bit and get: \\[p(x)= \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-1}{2}\\left(\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right)},\\] the . To sum it up: If one is to infer a probability distribution given certain constraints, out of all distributions \\(\\{p_i\\}\\) compatible with them, one should pick the distribution \\(\\{p_i^*\\}\\) having the largest value of \\(H\\) (De Martino and De Martino 2018). In other terms, a Maximum Entropy distribution is completely undetermined by features that do not appear explicitly in the constraints subject to which it has been computed. An overview of Maximum Entropy distributions can be found on Wikipedia. References "],

["app-93-data-sets-mental-chronometry.html", "D.1 Mental Chronometry", " D.1 Mental Chronometry D.1.1 Nature, origin and rationale of the data Francis Donders is remembered as one of, if not the first experimental cognitive psychologists. He famously introduced the subtraction logic which looks at difference in reaction times across different tasks to infer difference in the complexity of the mental processes involved in these tasks. The Mental Chronometry data set presents the results of an online replication of one such subtraction-experiment. D.1.1.1 The experiment 50 participants were recruited using the crowd-sourcing platform Prolific and paid for their participation. In each experiment trial, participants see either a blue square or a blue circle appear on the screen and are asked to respond as quickly as possible. The experiment consists of three parts, presented to all participants in the same order (see below). The parts differ in the adequate response to the visual stimuli. Reaction task The participant presses the space bar whenever there is a stimulus (square or circle) Recorded: reaction time Go/No-Go task The participant presses the space bar whenever their target (one of the two stimuli) is on the screen Recorded: the reaction time and the response Discrimination task The participant presses the F key on the keybord when there is one of the stimuli and the J key when there is the other one of the stimuli on the screen. Recorded: the reaction time and the response The reaction time measurement starts from the onset of the visual stimuli to the button press. The response variable records whether the reaction was correct or incorrect. For each participant, the experiment randomly allocates one shape (circle or square) as the target to be used in both the second and the third task. The experiment was realized using _magpie and can be tried out here. D.1.1.2 Theoretical motivation &amp; hypotheses We expect that reaction times of correct responses are lowest in the reaction task, higher in the Go/No-Go task, and highest in the discrimination task. D.1.2 Loading and preprocessing the data The raw data produced by the online experiment is not particularly tidy.

They should definitely never be chosen in such a way as to maximize the “desirability” of an analysis. Data cleaning is not a way of making sure that your favorite research hypothesis “wins”. Although we have not preregistered any data cleaning regime or analyses for this data set, we demonstrate a frequently used cleaning scheme for reaction time data, which does depend on the data in some sense, but does not require precise knowledge of the data. In particular, we are going to do this: We remove remove the data from an individual participant \\(X\\) if there is an experimental condition \\(C\\) such that the mean RT of \\(X\\) for condition \\(C\\) is more than 2 standard deviations away from the overal mean RT for condition \\(C\\). From the remaining data, we then remove any individual trial \\(Y\\) if the RT of \\(Y\\) is more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean of experimental condition \\(C\\) (where \\(C\\) is the condition of \\(Y\\), of course). Notice that in the case at hand, the experimental conditions are the three types of tasks. D.1.3.1 Cleaning by-participant Our rule for removing data from outlier participants is this: We remove remove the data from an individual participant \\(X\\) if there is an experimental condition \\(C\\) such that the mean RT of \\(X\\) for condition \\(C\\) is more than 2 standard deviations away from the overal mean RT for condition \\(C\\). We also remove all trials with reaction times below 100ms. This procedure is implemented in this code: # summary stats (means) for participants d_sum_stats_participants &lt;- d_preprocessed %&gt;% group_by(submission_id, block) %&gt;% summarise( mean_P = mean(RT) ) # summary stats (means and SDs) for conditions d_sum_stats_conditions &lt;- d_preprocessed %&gt;% group_by(block) %&gt;% summarise( mean_C = mean(RT), sd_C = sd(RT) ) d_sum_stats_participants &lt;- full_join( d_sum_stats_participants, d_sum_stats_conditions, by = &quot;block&quot; ) %&gt;% mutate( outlier_P = abs(mean_P - mean_C) &gt; 2 * sd_C ) # show outlier participants d_sum_stats_participants %&gt;% filter(outlier_P == 1) %&gt;% show() ## # A tibble: 1 x 6 ## # Groups: submission_id [1] ## submission_id block mean_P mean_C sd_C outlier_P ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 8505 discrimination 1078. 518. 185. TRUE When plotting the data for this condition and this participant, we see that the high overall mean is not just caused by a single outlier, but several trials that took longer than 1 second. d_preprocessed %&gt;% semi_join( d_sum_stats_participants %&gt;% filter(outlier_P == 1), by = c(&quot;submission_id&quot;) ) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = trial_number, y = RT)) + geom_point() We are then going to exclude this participant’s entire data from all subsequent analysis:20 d_cleaned &lt;- d_preprocessed %&gt;% filter(submission_id != d_sum_stats_participants$submission_id[1] ) D.1.3.2 Cleaning by-trial Our rule for exclusing data from individual trials is: From the remaining data, we then remove any individual trial \\(Y\\) if the RT of \\(Y\\) is more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean of experimental condition \\(C\\) (where \\(C\\) is the condition of \\(Y\\), of course). We also remove all trials with reaction times below 100ms. The following code implements this: # mark individual trials as outliers d_cleaned &lt;- d_cleaned %&gt;% full_join( d_sum_stats_conditions, by = &quot;block&quot; ) %&gt;% mutate( trial_type = case_when( abs(RT - mean_C) &gt; 2 * sd_C ~ &quot;too far from mean&quot;, RT &lt; 100 ~ &quot;&lt; 100ms&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;acceptable&quot; ) %&gt;% factor(levels = c(&quot;acceptable&quot;, &quot;&lt; 100ms&quot;, &quot;too far from mean&quot;)), trial = 1:nrow(d_cleaned) ) # visualize outlier trials d_cleaned %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = trial, y = RT, color = trial_type)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.4) + facet_grid(~block) + geom_point(alpha = 0.9, data = filter(d_cleaned, trial_type != &quot;acceptable&quot;)) So, we remove 63 individual trials. d_cleaned &lt;- d_cleaned %&gt;% filter(trial_type == &quot;acceptable&quot;) ## this version of the data is stored as cleaned # write_csv(d_cleaned, &quot;data_sets/mental-chrono-data_cleaned.csv&quot;) D.1.4 Exploration: summary stats &amp; plots What’s the distribution of total_time_spent, i.e., the time each participant took to complete the whole study? d_cleaned %&gt;% select(submission_id, total_time_spent) %&gt;% unique() %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = total_time_spent)) + geom_histogram() There are two participants who took noticably longer than all the others, but we need not necessarily be concerned about this, because it is not unusual for participants of online experiments to open the experiment and wait before actually starting. Here are summary statistics for the reaction time measures for each condition (= block). d_sum_stats_blocks_cleaned &lt;- d_cleaned %&gt;% group_by(block) %&gt;% nest() %&gt;% summarise( CIs = map(data, function(d) bootstrapped_CI(d$RT)) ) %&gt;% unnest(CIs) d_sum_stats_blocks_cleaned ## # A tibble: 3 x 4 ## block lower mean upper ## &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 reaction 296. 300. 304. ## 2 goNoGo 420. 427. 435. ## 3 discrimination 481. 488. 494. And a plot of the summary: d_sum_stats_blocks_cleaned %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = block, y = mean, fill = block)) + geom_col() + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), size = 0.3, width = 0.2 ) + ylab(&quot;mean reaction time&quot;) + xlab(&quot;&quot;) + scale_fill_manual(values = project_colors) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) D.1.5 Data analysis We are interested in seeing whether the mean RTs are smallest for the ‘reaction’ task, higher for the ‘go/no-go’ task, and highest for the ‘discrimination’ task. We test this with a hierarchical Bayesian regression model, taking participant-level variation of intercets and slopes for factor block into account. We make ‘go/no-go’ the default level of the block factor, so that we can directly test our directed hypothesis, using posterior parameter inference. # making &#39;go/no-go&#39; the reference level ## TODO: write convenience function for this kind of releveling reflevel &lt;- &quot;goNoGo&quot; reflevel_index &lt;- which(levels(d_cleaned$block) == reflevel) contrasts(d_cleaned$block) &lt;- contr.treatment( nlevels(d_cleaned$block), reflevel_index ) colnames(contrasts(d_cleaned$block)) &lt;- str_c(&quot;_&quot;,levels(d_cleaned$block)[-reflevel_index]) regression_model_ME &lt;- brm( formula = RT ~ block + (1 + block | submission_id), data = d_cleaned ) ## TODO tidy and concise output regression_model_ME We see that the value zero lies clearly outsie of the 95% credible interval for block ‘reaction’ and for block ‘discrimination’. The deviation from the intercept (zero point) is in the expected direction. We may conclude that, as hypothesized, reaction times in the ‘reaction’ condition are lowest, higher in the ‘go/no-go’ condition, and highest in the ‘discrimination’ condition. This may seem a harsh step, but when data acquisition is cheap, it’s generally not a bad strategy to be very strict in exclusion criteria, and to apply rules that are not strongly context-dependent.↩ "],
["simon-task.html", "D.2 Simon Task", " D.2 Simon Task The Simon task is pretty cool. The task is designed to see if responses are faster and/or more accurate when the stimulus to respond to occurs in the same relative location as the response, even if the stimulus location is irrelevant to the task. For example, it is faster to respond to a stimulus presented on the left of the screen with a key that is on the left of the keyboard (e.g. q), than with a key that is on the right of the keyboard (e.g. p). D.2.1 Experiment D.2.1.1 Participants A total of 213 participants took part in an online version of a Simon task. Participants were students enrolled in either “Introduction to Cognitive (Neuro-)Psychology” (N = 166), or “Experimental Psychology Lab Practice” (N = 39) or both (N = 4). D.2.1.2 Materials &amp; Design Each trial started by showing a fixation cross for 200 ms in the center of the screen. Then, one of two geometrical shapes was shown for 500 ms. The target shape was either a blue square or a blue circle. The target shape appeared either on the left or right of the screen. Each trial determined uniformly at random which shape (square or circle) to show as target and where on the screen to display it (left or right). Participants where instructed to press keys q (left of keyboard) or p (right of keyboard) to identify the kind of shape on the screen. The shape-key allocation happened experiment initially, uniformly at random once for each participant and remained constant throughout the experiment. For example, a participant may have been asked to press q for square and p for circle. Trials were categorized as either ‘congruent’ or ‘incongruent’. They were congruent if the location of the stimulus was the same relative location as the response key (e.g. square on the right of the screen, and p key to be pressed for square) and incongruent if the stimulus was not in the same relative location as the response key (e.g. square on the right and q key to be pressed for square). In each trial, if no key was pressed within 3 seconds after the appearance of the target shape, a message to please respond faster was displayed on screen. D.2.1.3 Procedure Participants were first welcomed and made familiar with the experiment. They were told to optimize both speed and accuracy. They then practiced the task for 20 trials before starting the main task, which consisted of 100 trials. Finally, the experiment ended with a post-test survey in which participants were asked for their student IDs and the class they were enrolled in. They were also able to leave any optional comments.

Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 5.648 6.905 7.692 21.617 9.113 1158.110 D.2.2.2 Summarizing &amp; cleaning the data We look at outlier-y behavior at the level of individual participants first, then at the level of individual trials. D.2.2.2.1 Individual-level error rates &amp; reaction times It is conceivable that some participants did not take the task seriously. They may have just fooled around. We will therefore inspect each individual’s response patterns and reaction times. If participants appear to have “misbehaved” we discard all of their data. (CAVEAT: Notice the researcher degrees of freedom in the decision of what counts as “misbehavior”! It is therefore that choices like these are best committed to in advance, e.g. via pre-registration!) We can calculate the mean reaction times and the error rates for each participant. d_individual_summary &lt;- d %&gt;% filter(trial_type == &quot;main&quot;) %&gt;% # look at only data from main trials group_by(submission_id) %&gt;% # calculate the following for each individual summarize(mean_RT = mean(RT), error_rate = 1 - mean(ifelse(correctness == &quot;correct&quot;, 1, 0))) head(d_individual_summary) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## submission_id mean_RT error_rate ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7432 595. 0.05 ## 2 7433 458. 0.04 ## 3 7434 531. 0.04 ## 4 7435 433. 0.12 ## 5 7436 748. 0.06 ## 6 7437 522. 0.12 Let’s plot this summary information: d_individual_summary %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = mean_RT, y = error_rate)) + geom_point() Here’s a crude way of branding outlier-participants: d_individual_summary &lt;- d_individual_summary %&gt;% mutate(outlier = case_when(mean_RT &lt; 350 ~ TRUE, mean_RT &gt; 750 ~ TRUE, error_rate &gt; 0.5 ~ TRUE, TRUE ~ FALSE)) d_individual_summary %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = mean_RT, y = error_rate)) + geom_point() + geom_point(data = filter(d_individual_summary, outlier == TRUE), color = &quot;firebrick&quot;, shape = &quot;square&quot;, size = 5) We then clean the data set in a first step by removing all participants identified as outlier-y: d &lt;- full_join(d, d_individual_summary, by = &quot;submission_id&quot;) # merge the tibbles d &lt;- filter(d, outlier == FALSE) message(&quot;We excluded &quot;, sum(d_individual_summary$outlier) , &quot; participants for suspicious mean RTs and higher error rates.&quot;) ## We excluded 5 participants for suspicious mean RTs and higher error rates. D.2.2.2.2 Trial-level reaction times It is also conceivable that inidividual trials resulted in early accidental key presses or were interrupted in some way or another. We therefore look at the overall distribution of RTs and determine (similarly arbitrarily, but once again this should be planned in advance) what to exclude. d %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = log(RT))) + geom_histogram() + geom_jitter(aes(x = log(RT), y = 1), alpha = 0.3, height = 300) Let’s decide to exclude all trials that lasted longer than 1 second and also all trials with reaction times under 100 ms. d &lt;- filter(d, RT &gt; 100 &amp; RT &lt; 1000) d %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = RT)) + geom_histogram() + geom_jitter(aes(x = RT, y = 1), alpha = 0.3, height = 300) D.2.2.3 Exploring the (main) data We are mostly interested in the influence of congruency on the reactions times in the trials where participants gave a correct answer. But here we also look at, for comparison, the reaction times for the incongruent trials. Here is a summary of the means and standard deviations for each condition: d_sum &lt;- d %&gt;% group_by(correctness, condition) %&gt;% summarize(mean_RT = mean(RT), sd_RT = sd(RT)) d_sum ## # A tibble: 4 x 4 ## # Groups: correctness [2] ## correctness condition mean_RT sd_RT ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 correct congruent 459. 105. ## 2 correct incongruent 484. 91.9 ## 3 incorrect congruent 460. 111. ## 4 incorrect incongruent 404. 95.4 Here’s a plot of the reaction times split up by whether the answer was correct and whether the trial was congruent or incongruent. d %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = RT)) + geom_jitter(aes(y = 0.0005), alpha = 0.1, height = 0.0005) + geom_density(fill = &quot;gray&quot;, alpha = 0.5) + geom_vline(data = d_sum, mapping = aes(xintercept = mean_RT), color = &quot;firebrick&quot;) + facet_grid(condition ~ correctness) D.2.3 Analysis We are interested in comparing the RTs of correct answers in the congruent and incongruent conditions. We saw a difference in mean reaction times, but we’d like to know if this difference is meaningful. One way of testing this is by running a regression model, which tries to predict RTs as a function of conguency. In the simplest case we would therefore do this: model_simple = brm(RT ~ condition, filter(d, correctness == &quot;correct&quot;)) summary(model_simple) ## Family: gaussian ## Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity ## Formula: RT ~ condition ## Data: filter(d, correctness == &quot;correct&quot;) (Number of observations: 23011) ## Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1; ## total post-warmup samples = 4000 ## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS ## Intercept 458.93 0.88 457.16 460.66 1.00 3492 ## conditionincongruent 25.54 1.28 23.09 28.09 1.00 3408 ## Tail_ESS ## Intercept 2580 ## conditionincongruent 2812 ## ## Family Specific Parameters: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS ## sigma 98.65 0.47 97.74 99.56 1.00 5426 2972 ## ## Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Eff.Sample ## is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential ## scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1). According to this analysis, there is reason to believe in a difference in RTs between congruent and incongruent groups. The coefficient estimated for the incongruent group is on average ca. 25 ms higher than that of the congruent group. However, we can also look at the interaction between correctness and condition. As shown in the above graph, there are four different cells in a 2x2 grid. In the below model, this is coded with ‘dummy coding’ such that the top-left cell (congruent-correct) is the intercept, and each other cell is calculated by the addition of offsets. model_complex &lt;- brm(RT ~ condition * correctness, d) We may want to ask the question: are reaction times to correct-congruent responses shorter than reaction times to incorrect-incongruent responses? To do this, we first need to extract the posterior samples from our model. post_samples &lt;- posterior_samples(model_complex) %&gt;% as_tibble() Then we need to determine the correct offsets to match the correct-congruent and incorrect-incongruent cells in the design matrix. # correct-congruent is the reference cell correct_congruent &lt;- post_samples$b_Intercept # incorrect_incongruent is the bottom-right cell incorrect_incongruent &lt;- post_samples$b_Intercept + post_samples$b_conditionincongruent + post_samples$b_correctnessincorrect + post_samples$`b_conditionincongruent:correctnessincorrect` Once we know these, we can calculate the probability that the comparison is in the correct direction. mean(correct_congruent &lt; incorrect_incongruent) ## [1] 0 "],
