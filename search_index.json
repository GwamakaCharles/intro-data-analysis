It uses R to handle, plot and analyze data. It relies on simulation to illustrate selected statistical concepts. 0.1 Testing This is a quote by Wickham (2014): Tidy datasets […] have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This is a plot: library(ggplot2) ggplot(diamonds, aes(color)) + geom_bar(fill = &quot;blue&quot;, alpha = .6) + theme_classic() References "],
