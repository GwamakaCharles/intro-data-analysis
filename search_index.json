It uses R to handle, plot and analyze data. It relies on simulation to illustrate selected statistical concepts. 0.1 Testing / Showcasing Don’t pay too much attention to what is written here. 0.1.1 Quotes This is a quote: Tidy datasets […] have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. — Wickham (2014) 0.1.2 Infobox At certain stages, possibly at the end of chapters or after important concepts, we might want to use a special infobox (see .infobox in styles.css) to summarise it or give food for thought. Like this: A horse walks into a bar and orders a pint. The barkeep says “you’re in here pretty often. Think you might be an alcoholic?”, to which the horse says “I don’t think I am.”, and vanishes from existence. See, the joke is about Descartes’ famous philosophy of ’I think therefore, I am&quot;, but to explain that part before the rest of the joke would be to put Descartes before the horse. 0.1.3 Plots This is a plot: library(ggplot2) ggplot(diamonds, aes(color)) + geom_bar(fill = &quot;blue&quot;, alpha = .6) + theme_classic() References "],
