It uses R to handle, plot and analyze data. It relies on simulation to illustrate selected statistical concepts. 0.1 Testing / Showcasing Don’t pay too much attention to what is written here. 0.1.1 Quotes This is a quote: Tidy datasets […] have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. — Wickham (2014) 0.1.2 Infobox At certain stages, possibly at the end of chapters or after important concepts, we might want to use a special infobox (see .infobox in styles.css) to summarise it or give food for thought. Like this: A horse walks into a bar and orders a pint. The barkeep says “you’re in here pretty often. Think you might be an alcoholic?”, to which the horse says “I don’t think I am.”, and vanishes from existence. See, the joke is about Descartes’ famous philosophy of ’I think therefore, I am&quot;, but to explain that part before the rest of the joke would be to put Descartes before the horse. We can have boxes with different icons for different purposes: This might be useful for excercises or general questions. Do you like it? Sometimes there are things that are really important, like exceptions to general rules. This box might be appropriate for these. “More research needs to be done” as an infobox. 0.1.3 Plots This is a plot of quite a famous dataset (Anscombe 1973): tibble( grp = rep(c(&quot;I&quot;, &quot;II&quot;, &quot;III&quot;, &quot;IV&quot;), each = 11), x = c(anscombe$x1, anscombe$x2, anscombe$x3, anscombe$x4), y = c(anscombe$y1, anscombe$y2, anscombe$y3, anscombe$y4) ) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x, y)) + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F) + geom_point(color = &quot;orange&quot;, size = 2) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) + labs(title = &quot;Anscombe&#39;s Quartet&quot;, x = NULL, y = NULL, subtitle = bquote(y == 0.5 * x + 3 ~ (R^2 %~~% .667) ~ &quot;for all datasets&quot;)) + facet_wrap(~grp, ncol = 2, scales = &quot;free_x&quot;) + theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;#f2f2f2&quot;, colour = &quot;white&quot;)) References "],

Elementary outcomes are mutually exclusive. The set \\(\\Omega\\) exhausts all possibilities.1 Example. The set of elementary outcomes of a single coin flip is \\(\\Omega_{\\text{coin flip}} = \\left \\{ \\text{heads}, \\text{tails} \\right \\}\\). The elementary outcomes of tossing a six-sided die is \\(\\Omega_{\\text{standard die}} = \\{\\) ⚀ , ⚁ , ⚂ , ⚃ , ⚄ , ⚅ \\(\\}\\).2 For simplicity of exposure, we gloss over subtleties arising when dealing with infinite sets \\(\\Omega\\). We make up for this when we define probability density functions for continuous random variables, which is all the uncountable infinity that we will usually be concerned with in applied statistics.↩ Think of \\(\\Omega\\) as a partition of the space of all possible ways in which the world could be, where we lump together into one partition cell all ways in which the world could be that are equivalent regarding those aspects of reality that we are interested in. We do not care whether the coin lands in the mud or in the sand. It only matters whether it came up heads or tails. Each elementary event can be realized in myriad ways. \\(\\Omega\\) is our, the modellers’, first crude simplification of nature, abstracting away aspects we currently do not care about.↩ "],
